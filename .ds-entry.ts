// design-sync entry point for @kontra/orchestrator-web.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the web package is a private Vite SPA with no library
// build and no barrel — its components are reached by deep path from `App.tsx`.
// The converter's fallback entry emits `export * from '<file>'` per source file,
// and `export *` does NOT re-export defaults; nearly every chrome component here
// is `export default`. Without this file they would be discovered by name and
// then be absent from `window.KontraDashboard`, so every preview card would fail
// with "Element type is invalid".
//
// This re-exports the real shipped components under stable named exports. It
// adds no markup and reimplements nothing. Scope is the five surfaces' reusable
// vocabulary — the shadcn primitives, the control-plane chrome, and the pieces
// the Actors and Workflows pages (including the sketch tab) are built out of.
//
// The PAGE components (ActorsPage, WorkflowsPage, DashboardPage, DatasetPage,
// SettingsPage) are deliberately excluded: each fetches on mount and owns live
// sockets, xterm or ag-grid, so a card would render an empty shell. The design
// agent composes pages; it does not import one.
//
// Kept in sync by hand. Adding a component here plus an entry in
// `.design-sync/config.json` `componentSrcMap` is what puts a card in the
// Claude Design project.

// React Flow's own stylesheet, which `main.tsx` imports for the same reason: it
// positions every `Handle` on its node's border. Without it the scratch nodes
// render with their ports stacked at the origin — so it has to reach a design
// through `_ds_bundle.css`, and a JS-side import is what puts it there.

// ── shadcn/ui primitives ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THREE, NOT FIVE. `Card` and `Textarea` were exported here for eight months after their
// implementations were deleted, and this file is why nobody noticed: `298c8d6` removed
// `src/components/ui/card.tsx` and `src/components/ui/textarea.tsx` on the evidence "no
// `from '…/card'` anywhere", having — its own message says so — "scanned every module under
// web/src". This barrel sat one directory ABOVE `web/src` and imported both. It is the second
// entry point of this package, and a sweep that walks only from `src/main.tsx` cannot see it.
//
// Nothing rendered a `<Card>` or a `<Textarea>` then and nothing does now, so the deletion was
// right and only its evidence was short. What is restored here is the barrel's own contract,
// stated at the top of this file: it re-exports the REAL SHIPPED components and reimplements
// nothing. A primitive that exists only for the design system is markup this app does not have.
//
// The break was invisible to `pnpm run typecheck` because `tsconfig.json`'s `include` listed
// `src`, `e2e` and `playwright.config.ts` — not this file. It lists this file now, so the next
// deletion of something the barrel names fails at the compiler instead of at a sync.
