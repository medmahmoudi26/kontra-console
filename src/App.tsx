/** App shell: the nav rail down the left, then the current surface.
 *
 * FIVE SURFACES, and Workflows is the centre. A workflow is a thread, each of its runs is a
 * conversation, and everything else here is what a run calls (**Actors**), what it produces
 * (**Datasets**), the machines under it (**Monitor**), and what the whole appliance is configured
 * with (**Settings**).
 *
 * TWO SURFACES WERE RETIRED, and neither was deleted from the address space.
 *
 *  - **Runs.** The global list made a run id and the code that produced it two different searches,
 *    so a run is reached through its workflow now. `/runs/<id>` still parses, still names that run,
 *    and REDIRECTS — see `state/address.ts`. It does not 404, because that address is in somebody's
 *    notes.
 *  - **Scratch.** A drawing surface with no subject (ADR 0026), which is why nobody opened it. It
 *    comes back as a workflow's own design tab. `/scratch` redirects to the list.
 *
 * THEIR PAGE COMPONENTS ARE GONE NOW, and this note is what is left of them. `RunsPage.tsx` and
 * `ScratchPage.tsx` were kept unrouted while their replacements were built, so the material could be
 * moved rather than thrown away; the move is done. A run's full account — transcript, drill, fleet
 * turns — is `Transcript.tsx`/`TranscriptDrill.tsx` under `/workflows/<workflow>/<run>`, and the
 * sketch is `WorkflowSketch.tsx` on that same surface's design tab. Two answers to "where does a
 * run's event log render", one of them unreachable, was the reason to finish it.
 *
 * The three-pane graph editor — catalog | canvas | inspector — went with the interpreter (ADR 0023
 * §12). There is no graph to edit: a Run is one execution of a caller's workflow and the caller
 * owns its loop.
 *
 * QUERY IS NOT A SURFACE. It is what a Dataset looks like when you open it — see `state/store.ts`'s
 * `View`.

 * cadence has to be a property of the app rather than of whichever page happens to be mounted.
 *

 * open tab, whether or not anything is happening. Two seconds is right while a sweep is running or

 * 200) plus that run's ledger read plus a visibility scan over every dispatch on the cluster, so
 * polling it at the detail's cadence would multiply the most expensive read in the app by the
 * number of runs on screen. The run you are WATCHING is refreshed at 2 s by `useRunTelemetry`,
 * which also refreshes this list the moment that run settles — so the one transition where a stale
 * row would be visibly wrong is the one that reconciles it.
 *
 * AND IT ONLY RUNS WHILE THE WORKFLOWS SURFACE IS OPEN, which is the change the pulse paid for. It
 * used to poll on every surface at 5–15 s, forever, because the nav rail derived "is anything
 * running" by filtering the array — so a session parked on the Datasets page all afternoon was
 * re-reading the entire run history of this controller for a two-digit number in the chrome. The
