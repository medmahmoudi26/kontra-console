/**
 * The seam that gets a Run's turns into the browser.
 *
 * THIS SUITE IS THE ARCHITECTURAL CLAIM, EXECUTED. `transcript.ts` and `vocabulary.ts` live in the
 * `orchestrator` package; this one is `frontend`. If the reducer could not be imported
 * across that boundary the reduction would have to become an HTTP route, so the first thing below
 * is that it CAN be — the same `@core` alias `@kontra/core/scratch` and `@kontra/core/caller` already use,
 * with `readVocabulary` producing kontra's own words from a reduced log this package fetched. It is
 * asserted rather than asserted-in-a-comment: a build that broke the alias fails here.
 *
 * NO PAYLOAD ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE, and that is the second claim. Every fixture is a REDUCED event
 * — the shape `/api/runs/:id/history` serves and the archive stores (ADR 0025) — with no `input`,
 * no `result` and no failure payload, because there is none in the thing the reader reads. A test
 * that had to hand the reducer a payload to get a turn out of it would be the first sign the
 * claim-check constraint (ADR 0007) had been broken by moving the reduction across the wire.
 *
 * `cat` IS NEVER HAND-WRITTEN. It comes from `history.ts`'s own `categorize`, so a fixture cannot
 * quietly disagree with the reducer about what counts as a failure — which is the one thing the
 * invisible-failure half of the vocabulary rests on.
 *
 * Node, no jsdom. `fetch` is a stub that routes by URL, so the two reads and their three failure
 * arms are asserted without a server.
