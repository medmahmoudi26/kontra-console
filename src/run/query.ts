 * The query workbench's client.

 * and gets rows back — there is no query engine in the browser, which is the whole point: the
 * page that used to ship 76 MB of DuckDB-WASM now ships a text editor.
 *
 * The routes are bearer-gated because they can read every dataset. The token is injected at
 * build time, so a deployment that does not set it gets a page that says "unauthorized" rather
 * than one that silently shows nothing.
