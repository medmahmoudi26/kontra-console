/**
 * Following a run's transcript: turns arriving in place, a finished run reopening identically, and
 * the three caps that stop a reader becoming the defect it was written not to reproduce.
 *
 * NO NETWORK, NO CLOCK, NO BROWSER. The hub takes its read and its scheduler as dependencies, so
 * every poll below is a function call and every assertion is about what the sink was handed —
 * which is what makes "the transcript gained turns without a refresh" an assertion rather than a
 * wait for two seconds and a hope.
 *
 * `cat` IS NEVER HAND-WRITTEN, the same discipline `turns.test.ts` keeps: it comes from
 * `history.ts`'s own `categorize`, so a fixture cannot quietly disagree with the reducer about what
 * counts as a failure — and the reducer is the thing deciding whether a run is still live.
