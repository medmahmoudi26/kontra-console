/**
 * The health chips (ADR 0020, slice 3).
 *
 * FOUR SIGNALS, FOUR ELEMENTS, NEVER ONE LIGHT. SSH reachable · session present · poller live ·
 * actor-host reload ratio. The case is the round-3 incident — one Machine failing 81 of 82 resource
 * loads while its run reported `completed` — where a single rolled-up indicator would have been
 * green, because three of the four signals were fine. Collapsing them is the bug; keeping them apart
 * is the feature.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ROW OWES A READER, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Three rules were added after an operator read a
 * real tile and found that four of its five chips told them nothing:
 *
 *   1. NOT APPLICABLE IS NOT UNKNOWN. An axis that cannot say anything about a pane in this mode is
 *      not a chip — `ssh: reachable` on a `local` pane is the page having loaded, not a health fact,
 *      and `loads` has no vmagent anywhere but the fleet. {@link signalApplies} owns the rule and
 *      states the evidence. Those axes are named in one muted `n/a` marker, so an operator can see
 *      that an axis was dropped and why; they are also still in the drawer, in full sentences.
 *
 *      THIS IS NOT THE COLLAPSE ADR 0020 FORBIDS, and the guard that keeps it honest is that
 *      omission is one-directional: a signal reading `bad` is rendered whatever its applicability
 *      says. The only thing this row can ever hide is a green or an unknown on an axis that is
 *      structurally incapable of being anything else. `unknown` is never rendered as `ok`.
 *
 *   2. SEVERITY LEADS. Chips are ordered `bad`, then `unknown`, then `ok`, stable within each group
 *      by {@link CHIP_SIGNALS}. A row where everything is fine reads as a quiet run of green; a row
 *      with a finding puts it first. It is also what makes rule 3 safe.
 *
 *   3. ONE LINE, ALWAYS. The row is `flex-nowrap` and clips, so a narrow tile can never wrap a lone
 *      chip onto a second row or leave a half-empty one — the wall packs many tiles and every pixel
 *      here is a line of output an operator cannot see. Clipping is only tolerable because of rule
 *      2: what falls off the right is always the least severe thing on the tile, and the container's
 *      `title` carries the whole reading.
 *
 * The SENTENCES moved out of the chips to make that possible. `HealthEntry.label` is `<signal>:
 * <state>`; `HealthEntry.text` is the sentence with the clause that says what to do, and it goes to
 * the tooltip and the drawer. The chips used to carry the sentence, which is how the row reached 91
 * characters and wrapped.
 *
 * `unknown` IS VISUALLY DISTINCT FROM `ok`, and not by shade. A lighter green is how "we don't know"
 * reads as "fine" at a glance across a wall of tiles, so the three states differ on four independent
 * channels at once — hue, fill, border style and glyph — which also means the distinction survives
 * greyscale, colour-blindness and a squinting operator. `heartbeat.ts` states the underlying rule:
 * "unknown" and "zero" must stay distinguishable.
 *
 * IT TAKES `health` AND RENDERS. No fetch, no socket, no state. The streamer is the only thing that
 * knows any of this, it arrives on `{t:'state'}` and `GET /api/panels/terminals`, and a component
 * that measured anything itself would be a second, disagreeing source of truth.
 *
 * The hooks are contract, per CONTRACT.md amendments 12 and 14: `data-testid="chip-<signal>"`,
 * `data-state` the normalized tri-state `ok|bad|unknown`, and `data-value` the RAW enum
 * (`present`, `no-tmux`, `none`, `failing`, …) so a spec can assert the specific failure without a
 * second vocabulary. Never select on a Tailwind class — restyling a chip must not read as a broken
 * stream.

/**
 * The first applicable signal that was never MEASURED — a different answer from a failing one, and

 *
 * ADR 0020's rule is that `unknown` must never render as healthy. That used to be discharged by the
 * chip row: `poller: unknown` sat on the tile in its own tri-state, whatever the bar below it did.
 * With the row gone the bar is the only health reading left on the wall, and the bar asked only
 * `leadingFinding`, which reports `bad` and nothing else — so a pane with two unmeasured signals
 * rendered a solid tmux green, indistinguishable from one where all four had been checked and were
 * fine. That is exactly the collapse the ADR forbids, reintroduced by removing the row.
 *
 * Ranked BELOW a failure, because "this is broken" outranks "this was not checked" — and reported
 * separately rather than folded into `Finding`, so the bar can colour the two differently. An
 * operator needs to tell "go fix the handler" from "this number is not being collected".
 *
 * `process` IS EXCLUDED, and that exclusion is the difference between a useful signal and a second
 * useless one. A kontra Worker runs from a hold shell so that a crash leaves its exit status on
 * screen, and that shell owns the pane's foreground process group — so `pane_current_command`
 * reports `zsh` whether the Worker is alive or finished. `process: unknown` is therefore not a gap
 * in collection, it is the permanent and correct reading for every pane kontra starts. Treating it
 * as unmeasured would turn every tile on the wall slate forever, which tells an operator exactly as
 * little as the always-green bar this was written to fix — and would bury `poller` and `loads`,
 * the two that genuinely mean "nobody is collecting this". A process that has EXITED is a different
 * matter and `barTone` already makes that bar red.
