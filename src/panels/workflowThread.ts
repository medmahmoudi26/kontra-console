/**
 * A workflow thread: which of the runs in the list are THIS workflow's, which one is open, and
 * what every tab is therefore about.
 *
 * A WORKFLOW IS A THREAD AND EACH RUN OF IT IS A CONVERSATION. That sentence is the whole of the
 * layout — the runs down one side, six readings of the open one beside them — and it is also the
 * whole of the arithmetic, because "which conversation" is a question that must be answered
 * against THIS thread and never against whatever the app happened to load last.
 *
 * IT LIVES APART FROM THE PAGE, like `workflowRow.ts` beside it and for the same mechanical
 * reason: `WorkflowsPage.tsx` imports CodeMirror, which cannot load under the test runner, so
 * anything that has to be asserted in isolation cannot ride in that file.
 *
 * THE JOIN IS `rowStatus`'s, CALLED RATHER THAN COPIED, and that is the point of this module
 * existing at all. #13 shipped a Workflows list that drew a RUNNING workflow as `NEVER RUN` because
 * it joined rows to runs by `guessTypeFromFilename` — `dhmonitor` guesses to `Dhmonitor`, the class
 * is `DockerLeakMonitor`, and the run list keyed on the real one. A page that re-derived the join
 * here would be a second place for that bug to live and a second place to have to fix it, so there
 * is one join, one test suite pinning it (`workflowRow.test.ts`), and this module inherits both.
 *
 * THE SAME BUG HAS A SECOND FLOOR, and it is the one this module is actually for. #13 was a wrong
 * STATUS on switch; a page with a run selected has a wrong RUN on switch — open `dnssweep`'s
 * `sweep-9`, click `nscheck`, and every one of five tabs is still drawing `sweep-9` unless
 * something says otherwise. So a selection is not a value this module carries over: it is a lookup
 * INSIDE the thread, re-answered on every render, and a run that is not this workflow's does not
 * become "the run" merely by having been one a moment ago. {@link threadOf} has three different
 * words for a run it cannot show, because "you switched threads", "it has not dispatched yet" and
 * "nobody selected anything" are three different sentences and only the first is a mistake.

 * a hint fails to build the day it is added, rather than rendering as a blank strip.

 * tab is an operator reading a machine's account of itself, and borrowing a consumer-chat name for
 * it imports the aesthetic the PRD ruled out. `transcript` is what the module that produces the
 * reading has always been called. A remembered `'chat'` fails {@link isTab} and lands on
 * {@link DEFAULT_TAB} — which is the very tab it named — so refusing it costs an operator nothing,
 * and accepting it would keep the word alive in the one place nobody would think to look.
 *

 * made two different readings share one pane and compete for it; they are not substitutable in
