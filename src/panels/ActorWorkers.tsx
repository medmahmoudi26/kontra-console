/**
 * WHO CAN ACTUALLY SERVE THIS ACTOR, drawn — the three facts, plus the sessions behind them.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. The rest of the card is registration: a folder, a digest, the Methods a worker
 * once declared. All of that survives the process that made it, so a card without this strip says
 * "this Actor exists" in a way that reads as "this Actor works". It does not, and the difference is
 * a dispatch that sits on a queue nobody polls while Temporal reports the run as running — a
 * failure this repo has documented as indistinguishable from the outside from a slow run.
 *
 * THREE STATES, NEVER TWO. `actorWorkers.ts` owns the vocabulary and the reasoning; this file draws
 * it. The one rule that lives here is that STALE IS RENDERED, in full, as its own state — a stale
 * worker is not omitted and not shown as a duller serving one, because "there is a worker, it is
 * dead" is the finding, and an empty list would read as "nobody has served this yet".
 *
 * AND AN ACTOR WITH NOTHING SERVING IT SAYS SO IN WORDS. Every negative state on this strip is a
 * sentence naming the queue and what to do about it, never a blank list: an empty rectangle is
 * indistinguishable from a strip that failed to load, and that is the reading this page cannot
 * afford.
 *
 * NO DISPATCH BUTTON HERE, deliberately. `dispatchTargets` is the list a dispatch may be aimed at
 * and it is exported for the probe (issue 15) to consume; what this component owes that slice is a
 * surface where a stale worker is visibly not a target, before anything can aim at one.
 *
 * PROPS IN, MARKUP OUT, no fetch and no socket — the poll lives in `ActorsPage`. It is drawn by
 * `actorWorkers.render.test.ts` in node with no jsdom, which is only possible because nothing on
 * this path touches xterm at module load.

 * colour cannot fake.
 *
 * `registered` IS THE ONE THAT IS NOT RED, and that is a decision rather than an oversight. It is a
 * MEASURED negative — Temporal answered, and nothing is polling — but it is also the ordinary state
 * of every folder an operator has registered and not yet served, and a page that painted those red
 * would be a wall of alarms about nothing, which is how a red stops being read at all. The Workflows
 * page settled the same question the same way: `idle` there is muted, because it is most workflows
 * most of the time. So this is grey and SOLID: distinct from the greens and reds by hue, and from
 * `unknown` by fill, border style and glyph — a measurement that found nothing, not a missing one.
