/**
 * Datasets: every one ever written, and the SQL console on the inside of each.
 *
 * EVERYTHING IS A DATASET. An actor's output for one dispatch and an operator-loaded list are
 * listed side by side and addressed the same way — by NAME, plus version and dispatch time when
 * they exist. No run ids, no graph node ids, no table hashes: a five-shard dispatch of one actor is
 * one dataset here, exactly as it is in `kontra dataset list`.
 *
 * THE QUERY WORKBENCH USED TO BE ITS OWN SURFACE, and folding it in here is a correction. It had a
 * schema tree down the left listing the same datasets this page listed, so an operator picked a
 * dataset twice: once to look at it, and again — by typing its name — to query it. Opening one now
 * IS opening its console. The schema shown is that dataset's, `SELECT * FROM <it>` is already in
 * the editor, and the engine, the export routes and `run/query.ts` are all unchanged; only the way
 * in moved.
 *
 * A LISTING ROW IS A TABLE ROW, NOT A CARD. Cards were pretty and unreadable at scale: a real
 * run has dozens of datasets, and the questions asked of the list — which is biggest, which is
 * newest, which is still open — are comparisons, and comparisons want columns.
 *
 * THE ENGINE IS ON THE SERVER. This page holds a text editor and a grid; the SQL travels to
 * `/api/datasets/query` and rows come back as JSON. It used to run DuckDB *in the browser* — 76 MB
 * of WebAssembly, re-downloaded per visit — so that it could range-read presigned parquet.

 * consequence explicit here, which is the whole difference between a single silent click and a
 * deliberate one.
 *

 * Dataset are reconciled in front of the person deciding. A tag means KEEP (ADR 0029 §3) and the
 * page says so on the chip — but a tag does NOT protect a temp from this button: the record is
 * keyed by the **Run** and the owner marker is what makes a temp deletable (ADR 0028), so the

/**
 * THE LISTING IS A DATAGRID, and the two rules issue #14 wrote for the RESULTS grid apply here for
 * the same reason — the app-level catalog poll re-renders this tree every ~2 s while any Run is
 * live, and a grid that resets on each tick is worse than the hand-rolled table it replaced:
 *
 *   1. THE COLUMN DEFINITIONS ARE ONE FROZEN MODULE CONSTANT, built once for the process. The
 *      results grid has to memoise on a schema signature because its columns ARE the query's
 *      columns; the listing's columns are fixed by this file, so they can be stronger than a memo —
 *      the poll cannot rebuild them because nothing rebuilds them. A new array, even with identical
 *      contents, is a changed prop and re-applies widths.
 *   2. THE DEFAULTS ARE ONE FROZEN SHARED OBJECT, never a per-render literal, for exactly the
 *      reason {@link GRID_DEFAULT_COL_DEF} records.
 *
 * And one more the results grid does not need: `getRowId`. The ROW DATA legitimately changes on
 * every poll — rows and bytes move while a Run writes — so without a stable id AG Grid replaces the
 * whole row set and takes the operator's scroll and selection with it. Keyed on `kind:name`
 * ({@link listingRowId}) the same Dataset stays the same row and only its cells update.
 *
 * WHAT A ROW IS: one **Dataset**, not one dispatch. That grain is `datasets/grouped.ts`'s decision
 * and it survives the port — three Runs appending to `lame` are one row, and `version`, `dispatch`
 * and `run` state the plurality inside it. What the port DOES give up is clicking one dispatch open:
 * the row opens the Dataset, and the console's own scope selector narrows it to a single **Run**,
 * which is the same rows by a better route (the run id is the thing that scopes `WHERE run_id = …`,
 * and a dispatch is a partition of it).

 * not want the same room), and `flex` in the shared default is precisely what re-shared every
 * column's width on each poll in #14. The two elastic columns declare `flex` themselves, inside the
 * frozen defs, so it is applied once rather than re-applied per render.
 *
 * NO TYPE INFERENCE, for the same reason as the results grid: AG Grid types a column from its first
