/**
 * The workflow thread: this workflow's runs down one side, six readings of the open one beside
 * them.
 *
 * A WORKFLOW IS A THREAD AND EACH RUN OF IT IS A CONVERSATION, which is the sentence the whole
 * layout is. The global Runs surface is retired because it made a run id and the code that produced
 * it two different searches; the fix is not a better list, it is putting the runs next to the
 * workflow and letting one selection govern everything else on screen.
 *
 * ONE SELECTION, SIX READINGS, AND NONE OF THEM SUBSTITUTABLE. Transcript is what the run did, in
 * kontra's words. Event log is what Temporal actually recorded. Code is what it ran. Scratch is what
 * it was meant to be. Monitor is the machines under it. Data is what came out. An operator who has
 * only the event log can reconstruct none of the other five, and an operator who has only the
 * Dataset cannot tell an empty result from a disaster — so they are tabs over one subject rather
 * than six places to go looking.
 *
 * IT TAKES THE HEAVY PANELS AS PROPS, which is the same split `Shell.tsx` makes and for the same
 * mechanical reason: the source viewer is CodeMirror and the worker pane is xterm, and neither can
 * load under the test runner. Handing them in means every state of this page — no runs, a run that
 * failed, a run that is parked, two hundred runs, and a selection that belongs to a workflow you
 * just left — renders in node as a string. It also means the Code tab shows the EXISTING editor
 * rather than a second one built to fit here, which is the instruction and is also the right call:
 * a read-only viewer with the folder's path and the registered digest beside it (ADR 0030) is not
 * something to have two of.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE STARTS A RUN. A **Run** is one execution of a caller's workflow (ADR 0023 §12), and
 * this page reads runs rather than minting them — there is no graph to interpret and no arbitrary
 * workflow to launch from a thread. Starting one stays where the input form and the queue already
 * are, on the page that knows which folder is registered.
 *
 * IT FOLLOWS NOW, AND IT STILL SAYS WHICH IT IS DOING. A live run's account arrives in place as the
 * run produces it, and a finished one reopens to the same transcript from the same reader — one
 * surface for "what is happening" and "what happened", which is the whole point of putting them on
 * one page. What the surface must never do is imply following it is not doing: `follow` is read from
 * the reader and printed beside the verdict, so a run nobody is watching says so.
 *
 * AND EVERY TURN STILL DRILLS, ACROSS THE SPLIT. The account is a rename of Temporal's events, and
 * a rename nobody can check is one nobody should trust (ADR 0027). The raw view used to open beneath
 * the transcript, which made two different readings share one pane and compete for it; it is a
 * sibling tab now. What the split must not cost is the check itself — so drilling a turn does not
 * merely mark a row, it CARRIES the reader to the Event log with those events in view
 * (`openDrill`), and the descent into a child workflow continues there. A drill that silently went
 * nowhere because the panes are now separate would be the whole vocabulary going unbacked.

 * closing that raw view gives the pane back to the whole log. Two event logs side by side would be
 * two answers to one question, so only ever one of them is here.
 *
 * THE RAW TEMPORAL TYPE IS ON EVERY ROW OF BOTH STATES, which is the promise the vocabulary rests
 * on: an event this release has no word for renders as ITSELF, never dropped and never guessed at.
 * HERE is where it renders, and only here. The transcript beside it is the domain account and stops
 * at the edge of what kontra can name — it says how many rows it is not drawing and that they are on
 * this tab, which is the honest half of the split. An operator who wants Temporal's own record has a
 * tab for it rather than three scheduler rows between two turns of the run's story.
 *
 * NEITHER HALF IS BUILT HERE. Both are handed in — `RunTail` polls and `TurnDrill` fetches a child's
 * history — the same split the viewer and the worker pane make, and for the same reason: every state
