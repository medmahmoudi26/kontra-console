 * What the Settings surface knows about a secret — all of it derived, none of it fetched twice.
 *
 * PURE, so every state this page can be in is a node test with no DOM: nothing here reads the
 * network, and the component that draws it takes rows as a prop.
 *
 * THE VOCABULARY IS THE POINT. An operator looking at this page cannot read a value back, so the
 * words have to carry the whole of what they can know: which version is CURRENT, which is
 * SUPERSEDED (still usable, which is what makes a rotation safe), and which is REVOKED (destroyed,
 * and not coming back). Collapsing superseded into revoked would make a rotation look like a
 * deletion, and an operator who believes that will not rotate.
