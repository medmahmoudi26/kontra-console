/**
 * The workflow's design tab: the sketch of what this workflow is meant to be made of.
 *
 * A DRAWING WITH A SUBJECT AT LAST. Scratch was a top-level surface holding a list of drawings
 * named by hand — a drawing surface about nothing, which is why nobody opened it. It is a tab here,
 * keyed to the workflow it is a sketch OF (`workflowScratchId`), and that single change is what
 * turns "what was this meant to be" from a search into an address. ADR 0026 survives unchanged and
 * is strengthened by the move: it was always a drawing that produces code, and it now has the one
 * thing it was missing.
 *
 * NOTHING ON THIS TAB RUNS, AND THERE IS NOTHING ON IT TO PRESS. No run, no play, no dispatch, on a
 * node or anywhere else — the canvas ADR 0023 §12 removed WAS the execution model, and a play
 * button on a node is the exact mistake the distinction exists to prevent. It is not left out by
 * discipline alone: this component is handed a document and two callbacks that edit it, and holds
 * no run id, no queue and no way to reach one. `workflowSketch.render.test.ts` asserts it over every
 * interactive element in the markup.
 *
 * THINGS THAT DO NOT EXIST YET ARE THE POINT. A workflow is designed before its parts are built:
 * you draw `nscheck.delegation → nscheck.ask`, look at the shape, and then go and write the two
 * Methods. So the Actor form takes free text rather than a picker — an Actor nobody has deployed
 * has no catalog row to pick a version off — and the catalog is offered as a `datalist`, which
 * helps and does not gate. What does not resolve is drawn in its own group, under
 * `resolveScratch`'s own sentence, which is the sentence the agent reading the spec will get.
 *
 * IT IS A BOARD AND NOT A CANVAS, and that is a deliberate trade rather than an unfinished one.
 * React Flow renders its nodes out of a store that only fills once the DOM has measured them, so
 * under this suite — node, no jsdom — a `<ReactFlow>` renders an empty `react-flow__nodes` div and
 * every assertion about what is on the tab becomes an assertion about nothing. The one property a
 * reviewer must be able to check first is that no node carries a run affordance, so the drawing is
 * laid out here and the NODE COMPONENTS ARE THE CANVAS'S OWN (`ScratchNodes.tsx`), reused rather
 * than rebuilt: the same four shapes, the same accents, the same handles, the same ports. The
 * `ReactFlowProvider` is borrowed for exactly one reason — `Handle` reads its store on the way to
 * rendering — which is the same thing `scratchNodes.render.test.ts` borrows it for.
 *
 * WHICH MEANS THE EDGES ARE SENTENCES HERE, not curves — `a.field → b.field`, with the author's own
 * word for the edge after it. Each end is named by `nodeLabel`, the words the canvas and the
 * inspector already share, so the tab is not a second renderer: the SPEC an agent reads is still
 * `renderScratch`'s and still only the server's (ADR 0026), and nothing here derives it a second
 * time.
 *
 * IT TOUCHES NONE OF THE DEAD EXECUTION-EDITOR STYLESHEET CLASSES — `.canvas`, `.actor-node`,
 * `.io-row`, `.mapping-table`, `.link-panel`, `.seed-table`, `.panel.inspector` — which are what
 * the interpreter left behind in `styles.css`, and reaching for one would be reaching for the
 * surface that ran things. Every utility used here is one this codebase already carries: the
 * stylesheet is a static compile, so a class nobody else uses is one the compiled bundle has no
 * rule for and which therefore silently does nothing. The one width that had no existing utility is
 * an inline style off `NODE_W`, which is where the node takes its own width from.

/**
 * The tab's state, read and written: the sketch for one workflow.
 *
 * A HOOK, HELD BY THE PAGE, AND THAT IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE. `WorkflowThread` renders ONE tab at a
 * time, so a component that owned this state would be unmounted the moment somebody looked at the
 * Transcript
 * — and the four pieces they had just placed and not yet saved would be gone when they came back,
 * silently, with the tab redrawing as though nothing had been drawn. Scratch is the only one of the
 * five readings that holds anything a person typed, so it is the only one that has to outlive its
 * own tab. The page owns it; the view is pure.
 *
 * IT IS KEYED TO THE WORKFLOW AND TO NOTHING ELSE. `workflowScratchId` derives the store key from
 * the name the folder is registered under, so opening a workflow opens its sketch and switching
 * workflows switches it — there is no list to pick from, which is the whole of what was wrong with
 * the surface this replaces.
 *
 * NOTHING IS FETCHED THAT THE PAGE ALREADY HOLDS. The Actor catalog, the workflow listing and the
 * lake come in as they are, because a second lookup would be a second opinion about what this
 * installation has, arriving at a different moment and with nothing to say which was right
 * (`scratchInspect.ts` states the same rule). The one call made here is the column schema, which is
 * catalog metadata rather than a scan — `querySchema` runs `DESCRIBE`, which opens no data file.
 *
 * A SAVE THAT ARRIVES AFTER A SWITCH IS DISCARDED, and so is a read. Both carry the workflow they
 * were asked for; painting either onto another workflow's tab is the same bug the run thread refuses
 * one layer up, and here it would put one run's design under another run's name.
