/**
 * The serve console, drawn — what an operator reads before and after pressing Serve.
 *
 * `renderToStaticMarkup` for the reason `HealthChips.test.ts` records: this suite runs in node with
 * no jsdom and no testing-library, and every assertion here is about text and `data-testid`, both of
 * which are in the markup.
 *
 * TWO OF THESE ARE ABOUT WHAT IS *NOT* THERE. A page that could serve an Actor to managed
 * containers or to a fleet from beside its editor would make "try this edit" and "deploy this" one
 * selection apart, and the second of those costs money and outlives the tab
 * (`backend/src/actorControl.ts`). An absent affordance leaves no trace in a diff, so it is
 * asserted rather than remembered.
