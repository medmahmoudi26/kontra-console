/**
 * One tile's banner: who it is, the controls — and the grab point for the wall.
 *
 * ONE ROW, BECAUSE THE STATUS LINE WENT WHERE TMUX PUTS IT. This banner briefly had two: a
 * hand-rolled address line, then `chrome/StatusLine.tsx` in its place. The bar is now the last
 * element of the TILE rather than the second row of its header — "put the green banner on the
 * bottom, like tmux" — so everything about the address, the session, the pane's command, the pane's
 * geometry and the frame's age is down there, and this strip is back to identity plus controls.
 *
 * THE HEIGHT IS A BUDGET RATHER THAN A STYLE, and moving the bar spent none of it. `grid/wall.ts`'s
 * row height was MEASURED against the chrome a tile carries — 132 px minus the banner and the health
 * chips leaves about five rows of terminal — so every pixel here is a line of a Machine's output an
 * operator cannot see. Two header rows plus the chips became ONE header row plus the chips plus the
 * same bar at the foot — the same elements in the same flex column, so the sum is unchanged by
 * construction and `WALL_ROW_PX` did not have to move. What would have cost a row is the other
 * version of the change: bar at the bottom, header still two rows. A narrow tile still DROPS what it
 * can afford to lose rather than wrapping.
 *
 * THE BANNER IS THE DRAG HANDLE, which is why it is a `cursor-grab` region with `select-none` and a
 * `touch-action: none`. A separate drag strip above the tile would be a fifth row of chrome on every
 * tile on the wall. The controls inside it stop the pointer with `stopPropagation`, so clicking "Go
 * live" is never the start of a drag.
 *
 * GOING LIVE IS A LABELLED BUTTON THAT SAYS WHAT IT COSTS. ADR 0020: the wall is snapshots, and only
 * a focused or explicitly pinned Terminal is a live PTY attach, because each one is an `sshd`
 * session, a PTY and a per-viewer tmux session on an `s-1vcpu-2gb` Machine. Slice 2 amendment 9
 * makes it "never a click, never a stray tab-stop", so it is not the tile's `onClick`, not the
 * menu's default item, and not something the sidebar can trigger.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE CAN PUT BYTES ON THE SOCKET. Copy reads xterm's buffer; the drawer is local state;
 * the converge names a Machine and the streamer composes the workflow. There is no input, no key
 * handler and no message type that carries a payload toward a session.
