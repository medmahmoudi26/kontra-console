/**
 * The status bar: what the wall is costing, and how stale it is (slice 7a).
 *
 * ITS JOB IS TO MAKE THE LIVENESS POLICY LEGIBLE. ADR 0020's mechanism is easy to state and invisible in
 * a screenshot: the wall is SNAPSHOTS — one `capture-pane` exec per node every few seconds paints every
 * tile on that node — and only a focused or explicitly pinned Terminal is a live PTY attach, because
 * twelve Machines cost twelve periodic execs rather than twenty-four persistent PTYs and twenty-four
 * `sshd` sessions on `s-1vcpu-2gb` boxes. An operator who does not know that reads a snapshot wall as a
 * broken live one ("why is it three seconds behind?") and reads the live budget as an arbitrary limit.
 * Four numbers and one sentence fix both.
 *
 * IT TICKS ITSELF, AND THAT IS A PERFORMANCE DECISION. Snapshot age has to advance once a second. If the
 * page owned that clock, every tick would re-render `DashboardPage`, `DashboardGrid` and up to
 * `WALL_TILE_CAP` tiles — a wall re-reconciled every second forever, for a number in a footer. So the
 * page hands over a GETTER that reads its refs, and the interval lives here: the clock re-renders exactly
 * this component. The same reason the frame path uses a subscription instead of React state.
 *
 * SNAPSHOT AGE IS OBSERVED IN THE BROWSER, NOT READ FROM THE INVENTORY. `Terminal.lastSnapshotAt` exists
 * and is the streamer's own timestamp, but it only arrives with `GET /api/panels/terminals` — which this
 * page polls every 30 seconds — so an age derived from it would itself be up to 30 seconds stale, and
 * "the oldest snapshot is 28s old" would be indistinguishable from "the inventory is 28s old". What the
 * page can state without qualification is when it last RECEIVED a frame for a Terminal, so that is what
 * is measured, and the label says `no frame yet` rather than inventing a zero.
