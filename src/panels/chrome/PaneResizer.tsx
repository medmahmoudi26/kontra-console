/**
 * The drag handle between two panes, and the height it owns.
 *
 * THIN, LIKE `useTerminalStyle`. Every decision is a pure function in `paneHeight.ts`; this file is
 * the three things that cannot be pure — `localStorage`, pointer capture, and a DOM element to grab.
 *
 * POINTER CAPTURE RATHER THAN WINDOW LISTENERS. A drag that leaves the handle — which is every drag,
 * because the handle is six pixels tall — has to keep receiving moves, and `setPointerCapture` is
 * the API that says so without a global listener that outlives the gesture. It also means the drag
 * ends on `pointerup` ANYWHERE, including outside the window, which a `mouseup` on the handle does
 * not.
 *
 * IT IS A REAL SEPARATOR, not a styled div. `role="separator"` with `aria-valuenow` is what makes
 * the arrow keys expected rather than surprising, and a resize that can only be done with a mouse is
 * a layout an operator on a trackpad cannot change.
