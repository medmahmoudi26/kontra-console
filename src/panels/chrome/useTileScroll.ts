/**
 * The wheel proxy and touch scrolling, wired to one tile's xterm (slice 7a).
 *
 * NON-PASSIVE, AND THAT IS WHY THIS IS A HOOK AND NOT AN `onWheel` PROP. React registers `wheel`,
 * `touchstart` and `touchmove` on its root container as PASSIVE listeners, so `preventDefault()` inside
 * a JSX `onWheel` is a console warning and a no-op — the browser scrolls anyway, and on a wall the thing
 * it scrolls is not the thing under the cursor. `addEventListener(..., { passive: false })` on the tile's
 * own wrapper is the only way to hold the default action, which is the entire mechanism: hold it, decide,
 * then move a `scrollTop` ourselves. `scroll.ts` holds the two decisions; this file is the plumbing.
 *
 * XTERM IS TOLD TO KEEP ITS HANDS OFF, via the public `attachCustomWheelEventHandler(() => false)`.
 * Without that there are two owners of one gesture: xterm's own wheel listener sits on the terminal
 * element, INSIDE our wrapper, so it runs first and would scroll the viewport before we got to decide —
 * and our proxy would then add a second scroll on top of it. Returning `false` from the custom handler is
 * xterm's documented "I handled it" and takes its whole wheel path off the table.
 *
 * WHICH ALSO REMOVES A BYTE PATH, and it is worth being precise about what was and was not there
 * before. Read from the shipped bundle: xterm's wheel listener, for a terminal with NO scrollback,
 * builds `ESC [ A`/`ESC [ B` from the wheel direction and calls `coreService.triggerDataEvent` — the
 * `onData` path. That was already inert here, because `triggerDataEvent`'s first line returns when
 * `disableStdin` is set (also read from the bundle) and because nothing subscribes `onData` and no
 * message in the outbound union carries bytes. So this is defence in depth, not a fix for a live bug:
 * ADR 0020's read-only guarantee is meant to rest on there being nothing to write to, and a code path
 * that assembles cursor keys at all is one `disableStdin: false` away from mattering. Now the branch is
 * unreachable.
 *
 * TOUCH IS THE SAME PROXY. `touchmove` follows the finger into the same `scrollTop`, and the flick
 * afterwards decays through `decayVelocity`. A tap is left alone: it must NOT go live (that takes the
 * header's own control — ADR 0020's cost model, and slice 2 amendment 9: never a click) and it must not
 * focus anything that could become a keyboard route into a read-only screen.
