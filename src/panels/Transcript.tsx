/**
 * A Run's account of itself, drawn.
 *
 * IT RENDERS A READING, IT DOES NOT MAKE ONE. Every word on screen here comes from
 * `@kontra/core/vocabulary` — the term, the label, the tone, the sentence under it, the concerns and the
 * chips — and this file decides only where each one goes. That split is what lets the whole
 * vocabulary be asserted in `vocabulary.test.ts` against bytes on disk while this file is asserted
 * as markup, and it is why a better word for something ships by changing one row of `TERMS` rather
 * than by touching a component.
 *
 * THE `because` IS ON THE ROW, NOT IN A TOOLTIP. A translation layer that renames confidently is
 * worse than raw events (ADR 0027, one level down), so every name here is shown beside the metadata
 * it rests on — the type, the endpoint, the attempt, the count of members. An operator who
 * disagrees with a name can see what it was read from and say so, which is the difference between
 * a vocabulary and a skin.
 *
 * THE CONCERNS ARE ABOVE THE TURNS, deliberately, and this is the half that is not cosmetic. A run
 * whose Units all failed closes `completed` with an empty Dataset and not one failure event
 * anywhere in its history; a dispatch onto a queue nobody polls reads `running` until a timeout
 * fires. Neither has a row that looks wrong, so neither is findable by reading rows — they are
 * raised at the top, from the same metadata, or they are invisible exactly as they have always
 * been.
 *
 * A FOLDED LOOP IS A `<details>`, WITH NO STATE ANYWHERE. Two hundred dispatches are one line until
 * somebody opens them, and the browser already owns that interaction — so expanding costs no
 * `useState`, no re-render of the transcript, and nothing this file has to remember when the
 * operator changes run. It also means the expanded case renders under `renderToStaticMarkup`, so
 * "the member that failed is in there" is a string assertion rather than a click.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE FETCHES AND NOTHING HERE POLLS, WHICH IS STILL TRUE NOW THAT IT STREAMS. Following is
 * `run/follow.ts`'s job; this file is handed a fresh reading whenever the run actually did something
 * and re-renders in place. There is no pulse on an arriving turn and no spinner between reads —
 * arrival is arrival, not animation — and the one thing this file DOES say about a live run is which
 * of the two it is: still open and being followed, or still open and not.
 *
 * EVERY TURN DRILLS. A name nobody can check is a name nobody should trust (ADR 0027), so each row
 * carries the count of Temporal events it folded and opens onto them. It is a button rather than a
 * hover, because a reader who has to discover the check does not have it.
 *
 * AND IT DRAWS THE DOMAIN ACCOUNT, NOT THE EVENT LOG. `named.turns` is what kontra has a word for;
 * the turns it has none for are `named.untranslated` and belong to the sibling tab, verbatim. That
 * boundary is `vocabulary.ts`'s and is not re-decided here — this file could not draw a
 * `WorkflowTaskScheduled` if it tried, which is the point of making the split upstream. It cost a
 * real run's only human-written sentence its reader to have both in one column: three rows of
 * scheduler bookkeeping either side of it, and the operator scrolled past the one line that
 * mattered. What the pane still owes that reader is the COUNT of what it is not drawing, which is
 * {@link Chips}' second half.

  /**
   * A SENTENCE IS A LOG LINE, NOT A TURN OF THE SHAPE BELOW.
   *
   * Every other row here answers "what KIND of thing happened, and how far into the run" — that is
   * what a derived turn has to say, and the kind label and the `+0.4s` are the answer. A narration
   * is the one row that is not derived from anything: an author called `speak` and wrote a line for
   * a person to read. Drawn in the common shape it came out as `+0.4s  note  <sentence>`, with two
   * pieces of machinery standing in front of the only thing anybody wanted — and the `note` label
   * says nothing the sentence does not.
   *
   * So it reads `<wall clock> — <sentence>`, in the reader's own timezone: an operator wants to know
   * WHEN something was said in the same terms as the rest of their day. The offset is not thrown
   * away, it is demoted to the row's `title`; and the drill stays, because a name nobody can check
   * is a name nobody should trust (ADR 0027) and that rule has no exceptions.
