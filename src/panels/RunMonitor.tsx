/**
 * The Monitor tab: the Machines under THIS run, and one of their panes.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED IS THE SCOPE, NOT THE PANE. The tab used to hold one `WorkerPane` — the worker
 * serving this workflow — and the wall of everything else was a surface away, where an operator who
 * had just started a four-Machine sweep filtered sixty tiles by hand to find their own four. This
 * draws the run's own Machines, from the run's own account (`runMachines.ts`), and the pane below is
 * that same component with the Terminal handed to it. Nothing about the pane is rebuilt or
 * restyled: it is the same header, the same tile, the same snapshot rule, the same link out to the
 * Monitor where ADR 0020 says a pane may be promoted to a live attach.
 *
 * FOUR ABSENCES, FOUR SENTENCES, because this codebase does not let "nobody looked" and "nothing
 * there" render the same:
 *
 *   no run          nothing is selected. Not a fact about any run.
 *   not read yet    the run's account has not arrived, so which Actors it called is UNKNOWN — an
 *                   empty list here would report a four-Machine sweep as machine-less for as long
 *                   as the transcript took to load.
 *   nothing named   the account IS read and the run dispatched nowhere and brought nothing up. A
 *                   real and ordinary state for a run that only read a Dataset.
 *   none matched    the run named its Actors and its fleet, and no Terminal in the inventory is
 *                   serving any of them. THIS IS THE INTERESTING ONE — it is what a worker that
 *                   booted and died looks like from here — so it prints the names it looked under.
 *
 * AND THE WHOLE INVENTORY BEING EMPTY IS SAID SEPARATELY, because "the streamer can see no Terminals
 * at all" is a fact about the appliance and not about this run.
 *
 * IT TAKES THE PANE AS A PROP, like everything else the thread frames: xterm cannot load under the
 * test runner, so handing it in is what lets every state above be asserted in node as a string.
 *
 * `RunDataTab` IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS FILE, and it is here rather than in one of its own because
 * it is the other half of one question. "What did this run actually do" is answered from two ends —
 * the Machines under it and what came out of it — and neither is derivable from the other (ADR 0017
 * keeps execution and materialization apart for exactly that reason). Both are filters over a
 * listing the app already polls, both are scoped by the same open **Run**, and both draw an absence
 * rather than an empty box.
