/**
 * The tmux pane a served worker is running in, beside the editor.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS BESIDE AN EDITOR AT ALL. A worker fails in ways nothing else on either surface can
 * report. A stray tab is a `TabError` at import; a missing package is an ImportError; a queue
 * nobody serves is a Run that simply waits. In all three the file saves, Serve returns
 * successfully, Run starts a workflow, and every status stays green — the evidence is a traceback in
 * a pane an operator had to know to go and attach to. Putting the pane here is the difference
 * between "my workflow hangs" and reading the exception.
 *
 * BOTH CALLERS' WORKERS, ONE PANE. The Workflows page serves a caller's workflow and the Actor
 * workbench serves an Actor; the two mint their session names by different rules, so the NAME is
 * the caller's to derive and this component's job starts at finding it. A second terminal for the
 * Actors page would have drifted on the two things that are load-bearing here — the snapshot-only
 * rule below, and the patience while the streamer rediscovers a session.
 *
 * IT IS A SNAPSHOT, NEVER A LIVE ATTACH. ADR 0020's cost model: the wall is snapshots, and a live
 * attach is an sshd session, a PTY and a per-viewer tmux session on the node. A pane that quietly
 * went live because it happened to be on screen would spend that budget without anyone choosing to.
 * The Monitor is where a pane is promoted, and the link goes there.
 *
 * IT RESOLVES A SESSION NAME, NOT AN ID. A serve answers with the session it created, and the
 * streamer discovers that session on its own cadence — so a Terminal for a session created a second
 * ago does not exist yet. Polling briefly is the difference between "not yet" and reporting "no
 * pane" about a worker that is running perfectly well.
 *
 * UNLESS THE CALLER ALREADY HAS THE TERMINAL, which is the one thing added for the run-scoped
 * Monitor and is additive to every existing caller. A session name cannot address a MACHINE — nine
 * droplets running one Actor answer to one session name — so a surface that scopes panes to a run's
 * Machines picks by id and hands the object in. See the `terminal` prop; nothing else here changed.

 *    same rule the local one uses, so nine droplets running `probe` 0.1.0 all answer to one name and
 *    the resolver returns the local match, else the first. Right for "where is the worker I just
 *    served"; wrong when the operator has picked one of a run's Machines by id, where any other pane
 *    under that name is somebody else's screen.
 *
 * A `null` TERMINAL IS A CALLER SAYING IT HAS NOTHING TO SHOW, and is not the same as omitting the

 * meanings, and the second must draw the empty state rather than start polling for a name nobody
