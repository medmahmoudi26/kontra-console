/**
 * From a domain turn down to the raw Temporal events it folded — and, one more step, into the
 * child workflow those events are about.
 *
 * WHY THE DRILL IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE VOCABULARY AND NOT A POWER-USER FEATURE. A translation
 * layer that renames confidently is worse than raw events (ADR 0027): "batch dispatched" is a claim
 * about six `NexusOperation*` rows, and a reader with no way to check it has been asked to trust a
 * rename made by a release they cannot see. The check is what makes the rename affordable. So every
 * turn drills, including the ones this release has no word for — an untranslated row is the case
 * where checking matters MOST, and it would be the easiest one to leave out.
 *
 * AND IT COSTS NOTHING AT THE ROOT. `transcript.ts` puts the event ids on every turn ("THE DRILL
 * PATH"), and `RunTurnsRead` now carries back the reduced log those ids index — the same response
 * the account was read from. So opening a turn's raw events is arithmetic over bytes the page
 * already holds: no fetch, no spinner, and no reason for anyone to argue that the friendly view is
 * the cheap one.
 *
 * A CHILD IS JUST ANOTHER WORKFLOW ID, which is `history.ts`'s trick and this module inherits it
 * whole: one route takes any id, so descending costs one read of the same shape, decodes the same
 * number of payloads (none), and needs no second set of rules. `eventDrill.ts` already owns what a
 * click DOES — the stack, the return-not-push rule, the crumb labels — and is called rather than
 * re-implemented, so a dispatch inside a fleet-scoped child has the two places to go back to that
 * it has always had.
 *
 * Everything here is pure: turns and a reduced log in, rows out. The fetching lives in the panel.
