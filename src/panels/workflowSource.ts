/**
 * Reading a workflow file well enough to be useful — and no further.
 *
 * Two questions, both of which the Workflows page needs an answer to before it can prefill a
 * field or print a command an operator can paste:
 *
 *   1. What can I `kontra workflow start`?  → the `@workflow.defn` type names.
 *   2. What has to be up first?             → the Actors it dispatches to, the Datasets it reads
 *      and writes, and whether it provisions its own Machines with `fleet.up(...)`.
 *
 * WHY NOT A PYTHON PARSER. Because the answer does not have to be exact to be honest. This is a
 * text scan whose failure mode is a missing line in a printed checklist, which the operator reads;
 * a real parser in the browser (a WASM tree-sitter, say) would be megabytes to make the same list
 * slightly more complete. What it does NOT do is decide anything at runtime — nothing here
 * executes, dispatches or schedules, so being wrong costs a wrong hint, never a wrong run. The
 * limits are recorded on each function.
 *
 * THE DOCSTRING STRIP IS THE LOAD-BEARING PART, and it is why the naive version of this belongs in
 * the bin. `nscheck.py`'s module docstring contains the very commands this page generates —
 * `kontra workflow start nscheck` — plus an ASCII diagram naming its own methods. A
 * scan that does not blank comments and triple-quoted strings first reads documentation as code.

   *
   * PROMOTION IS A WRITE, and missing it under-reports what a workflow outputs to zero. Slice 02
   * rewrote `nscheck` to STAGE every verdict into a temporary Dataset and PROMOTE only the lame ones
   * into `lame` with `insert_from` after the fleet is gone (ADR temp-datasets §02). A workflow whose
   * ONLY output is promoted — no direct `.writer()` on the named Dataset at all — then showed no
   * output whatsoever, which is the one thing a run-output panel exists not to do.
   *
   * WHY IT IS WORTH SCANNING FOR. Reading and writing a Dataset are the same call up to the
   * `.writer()`, so a page that could not tell them apart summed a workflow's INPUT list into its

   * announced 1,023 committed units one second after Run, before a single Machine existed. A number
   * that large and that wrong, on the stat an operator uses to decide whether a run is
   * working, is worse than no number.
   *
   * Absent means "not seen as a writer", which is not the same as "read-only" — a name built from a
   * variable is invisible to this scan either way. The run's own materialization ledger is the
   * authority once it has anything to say; this is what the page has before then.
