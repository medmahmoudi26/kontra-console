/**
 * "Call this Method", drawn: the Batch form, the Run button, the caller it would take to do this
 * yourself, and what came back.
 *
 * IT CALLS THE METHOD (ADR 0033). This panel used to write a file and say so in words, because
 * there was no server-side dispatch to collect a Batch for. There is now: a kontra-owned one-shot
 * workflow performs exactly ONE Method call over this Batch, through the same Nexus operation
 * production uses, and writes into an untagged Dataset. So the button does the thing it says.
 *
 * AND IT IS STILL NOT THE INTERPRETER, which is a COUNT rather than a promise: one Actor, one
 * version, one Method, one Batch. There is no control on this panel that adds a second Method, a
 * branch, a loop or a fan-out width, because the request has no field for one (ADR 0033 §1). Two
 * Methods is a topology and belongs in the operator's own workflow — which is exactly what the
 * source block below the button is for.
 *
 * THE CALLER SURVIVES AS A READ-ONLY ARTEFACT (§6). It is regenerated as the form changes — a
 * source block that outlives its form is a lie — and it is what the probe actually runs, not an
 * illustration of it. What went is the errand: no save target, no folder shelf, no write.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS THIS PANEL MUST NOT COLLAPSE, and each one is a bug it has been fixed for:
 *
 *   • A STALE WORKER IS NOT A WORKER. Temporal lists a poller for about five minutes after it
 *     stops, so a Run offered against a stale queue sits on a queue nobody drains and reads as
 *     slow. `actorWorkers.ts` is the authority; the button is disabled with the reason in it.
 *   • UNKNOWN IS NOT NO. Temporal could not be asked is a missing answer, not a negative, and the
 *     button says which.
 *   • A DROP IS NOT AN EMPTY RESULT. `probeVerdict` owns that distinction — see it.
 *   • A METHOD THAT DECLARES NOTHING SAYS SO AND NAMES THE FIX, rather than offering an empty form
 *     that claims the Method takes nothing.
 *
 * PROPS IN, MARKUP OUT — no fetches, no state, and nothing imported that reaches xterm. That is
 * what lets `methodCall.render.test.ts` draw every state of it in node with no jsdom;
 * `MethodCall.tsx` is the half that talks to the server.

/**
 * The Batch itself: a table of Units when the Method declared its input, one JSON box when not.
 *
 * THE COLUMNS ARE THE LEAVES AND THE REST OPENS UNDER THE ROW. A Batch is a list, so the form is a
 * table an operator scans down — and a nested `retry` object or a repeatable `targets` list cannot be
 * a cell without making every row as tall as the deepest thing in the schema. So the scalars stay
 * columns, and a Unit with more than that gets a disclosure that opens the nested fields beneath it,
 * drawn by the SAME component the Workflows run form uses. A table nested inside a table was the
 * other option and it is unreadable at the second level.
