/**
 * A registered workflow's contract, read and drawn.
 *
 * BOTH READINGS EXIST IN THE SHIPPED WORKFLOWS. `ping` annotates `dict`, which pydantic derives as
 * a schema with no `properties` — "any object"; drawn as an empty field table it reads as "this
 * workflow takes an object with no fields in it", the opposite of what it says. `nscheck` now names
 * its request (`NsCheckInput`, instrument-panel slice 01), so its input derives `properties` and
 * draws a field table. The fixtures here are the real emissions (see tests/test_workflow_catalog.py,
 * which pins the same documents from the Python side), not documents written to make this pass.
 *
 * `renderToStaticMarkup` for the reason `HealthChips.test.ts` records: this suite runs in node with
 * no jsdom and no testing-library, and every assertion is about text and `data-testid`, both of
 * which are in the markup.
