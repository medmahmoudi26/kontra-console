/**
 * A tile showing a widget instead of a screen (ADR 0020, slice 7b).
 *
 * This is what slice 7a's `TerminalTile` mounts in place of the xterm container when
 * {@link parseWidget} recognises the captured text. It is deliberately thin: a header, a scroll
 * container, and `Markdown`. Everything about what is safe to render lives in `Markdown`, and
 * everything about what counts as a widget lives in `parseWidget`.
 *
 * IT SAYS WHERE THE CONTENT CAME FROM, and that is a security control rather than decoration. A
 * rendered document looks authored — headings, tables, links — while this one was PRINTED BY A PANE,
 * which on this wall means it may be quoting a crawled page. The badge is how an operator knows the
 * difference between the Dashboard telling them something and a target telling them something. The
 * same reason `DashboardPage` says a Terminal is not a record.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT REPLACE THE TERMINAL PERMANENTLY. A widget is a property of the CURRENT screen, so a
 * pane that stops printing the marker goes back to being a terminal on the next snapshot. That is the
 * tile's decision, not this component's — it renders what it is given.
