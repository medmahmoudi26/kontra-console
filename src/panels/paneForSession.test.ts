/**
 * Which pane a workbench draws when two Machines answer to one session name.
 *
 * This is a real collision and not a hypothetical: `backend/src/panels/discovery.ts:
 * sessionNameFor` names a fleet Machine's session `<actor>-<version>`, which is exactly what
 * `@kontra/core/panels/tmux:actorSession` derives for the local worker — so a droplet running probe 0.1.0 and the worker
 * the Serve button just started are both called `probe-0_1_0`.
