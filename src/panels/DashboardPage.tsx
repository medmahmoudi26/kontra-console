/**
 * The Monitor — a wall of read-only Terminals over tmux (ADR 0020, slices 1–4).
 *
 * THE WALL IS THE INVENTORY, FREELY ARRANGED. Every Terminal the streamer reports gets a tile, and
 * a tile is a rectangle an operator drags and resizes (`grid/wall.ts`). It used to be a list of
 * SLOTS holding selectors, with tiles materialised by evaluating them; `grid/wall.ts`'s header
 * records what that traded away and why the trade reversed. What has not changed is the property
 * the slots existed to protect: this page re-reads the inventory on its own cadence and `syncWall`
 * places whatever is new, so `fleet up --count 10` still fills the wall with no edit and no reload.
 *
 * THE PAGE OWNS THE TRANSPORT; A TILE OWNS ITS SCREEN. One socket per tab carries every Terminal, and
 * a tagged binary frame is routed to whichever tile registered for that id. Everything about xterm,
 * the measured geometry and the repaint rule lives in {@link TerminalTile}; everything about where
 * tiles sit lives in `grid/TileWall.tsx`. This file is what connects the two, plus the four things
 * that can only be decided centrally: the subscription set, the live budget, the inventory refresh
 * and the notices.
 *
 * THE WALL IS SNAPSHOTS. ADR 0020: one `capture-pane` exec per Machine paints every tile on it, and
 * only a focused Terminal is a live PTY attach. So this page must never promote a wall: 24 tiles going
 * live would be 24 `sshd` sessions and 24 PTYs on `s-1vcpu-2gb` Machines, which is the cost model the
 * ADR exists to avoid. Going live takes a tile's own control (slice 2 amendment 9 — never a click,
 * never a tab-stop), it is honoured only inside {@link LIVE_BUDGET}, and promoting past the budget
 * DEMOTES the oldest and says so. Nothing on this page promotes automatically any more: pinned slots
 * were the only thing that could, and they went with the slot document.
 *
 * YOU CANNOT TYPE IN A TERMINAL. No `onData`, no key handler, and no message in the outbound union
 * carries bytes — ADR 0020's finding (3) measured `run-shell` and `send-keys` both executing through a
 * read-only tmux client with no error, so read-only is a property of this code and the streamer's
 * message table, never of tmux.
 *
 * A TERMINAL IS NOT A RECORD, and the page says so. Snapshots are lossy by construction (a screen, not
 * a log), a live attach is lossier still, and the Manifest, the journal on the Machine and the lake are
 * the record.

        · `snapshotRound` builds its exec list from live subscriptions only, and per NODE-AND-SESSION
          with the set of WINDOWS as an argument. An unsubscribed window leaves that argument list;
          the last window of a session takes the whole `capture-pane` exec with it, every 3 s,
          forever. On a wall of many tiles that is the whole point.
        · `fanOut` delivers to subscribers, so the bytes, the byte budget and the elided accounting
          for that Terminal stop.
        · `announceHealth` walks subscriptions, so its `{t:'state'}` messages stop.
        · a LIVE attach is given up: the tile unmounts and blurs itself (`TerminalTile`'s unmount
          effect), and `demote` below covers the case where the id leaves `wanted` while its tile is
          still mounted. Either way the `sshd` session, the PTY and the per-viewer grouped tmux
          session on the node are killed and the `LIVE_BUDGET` slot is freed.

      WHAT IT DOES NOT STOP, and this is the honest half: the streamer's own 30 s pass. `refresh()`
      discovers and PROBES every Machine, and measures fleet health, whether or not anybody is
      subscribed to anything — that is `list-panes`/`has-session` per node plus one Temporal and one
      metrics query per fleet, and it is what `GET /api/panels/terminals` and the sidebar tree are
      made of. Hiding a pane is not a way to stop probing a Machine, and nothing here pretends it is.
