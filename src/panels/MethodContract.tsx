/**
 * What a Method IS, drawn once: its name, what its author said it does, and its three schemas.
 *
 * IT LIVED IN `ActorCard.tsx` AND TWO SURFACES NOW DRAW IT. The Actors page lists an Actor's
 * Methods on its card; Scratch's inspector lists the same Methods so an author can see which one a
 * node uses and change it. A second rendering would disagree eventually — and the one in Scratch is
 * the one nobody would notice going stale, because nobody opens a sketch to audit a field table.
 * So the row moved here and both import it.
 *
 * THE THREE ANSWERS ABOUT A SCHEMA STAY THREE. `not declared`, `no fields` and a table are
 * different facts — an actor that declares nothing (`examples/go/dnsfacts`) and one whose Method
 * takes nothing are not the same thing to a caller, and only one of them can be called with
 * anything. That distinction is the reason a field table is worth drawing at all, and it is why
 * {@link schemaFields} answers `null` rather than `[]` for an absent schema.
 *
 * AND AN UNDESCRIBED METHOD SAYS SO. Descriptions travel now (`209b0ad`): Python reads the
 * docstring's first paragraph, Go types the same sentence into `Does("…")`. Both SDKs omit the key
 * rather than sending `""`, so a Method with no description is an author who wrote none — a fixable
 * omission by the person reading the row, not a field the system lacks — and the row says THAT
 * rather than leaving a blank line where a sentence goes.
 *
 * NO DOM AT MODULE LOAD, deliberately, for the reason `ActorCard.tsx` records: the suites here run
 * in node with no jsdom, and anything that reaches xterm or CodeMirror on the way in fails a whole
 * test file with `ReferenceError: self is not defined` before a test runs. This module imports
 * lucide, the shared Button, types and the pure schema reader — nothing else — so both surfaces'
 * render tests can draw it.
