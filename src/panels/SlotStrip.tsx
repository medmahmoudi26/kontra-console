/**
 * What an Actor will ask for, on its card — BEFORE it runs.
 *
 * This is half the point of the whole slice. An actor's Methods and their schemas say what it
 * takes; nothing on this page said what it will ASK FOR, so the first time an operator learned
 * that a third-party actor wanted a credential was when a run failed inside `@actor.load`. The
 * strip below is that fact, on the surface where somebody is already deciding whether to serve
 * this code.
 *
 * PROPS IN, MARKUP OUT. It takes a view and draws it, so unbound / bound / revoked / gone are four
 * renders and no mocks (`slots.render.test.ts`), and the card that hosts it needs no fetch.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A CONTROL. Binding happens in Settings, beside the secrets it binds to — a
 * picker on this card would need the operator's whole secret inventory on the Actors page, which
 * is a list of credential names on a screen opened to read code. The strip states the situation
 * and says where the fix is.
