/**
 * One React Flow node component per kind of thing a Scratch can name.

 * FOUR SHAPES, NOT ONE BOX WITH A LABEL. An Actor's Method, a caller workflow, a Dataset and a note
 * are four different things to whoever reads the sketch back, and the surface they replaced drew
 * them as the same rectangle in three colours — which meant telling a Dataset from an Actor was
 * reading the text on it. Each carries its own icon, its own second line, and its own accent.
 *
 * THERE IS NO RUN AFFORDANCE HERE, and there never should be (ADR 0026). The canvas 0023 §12
 * removed WAS the execution model; this one is input to writing the program that is. A play button
 * on a node is the exact mistake that distinction exists to prevent.
 *
 * Typed with the base `NodeProps` and narrowed at the boundary, the way v1's ActorNode was: React
 * Flow's `nodeTypes` registry is a map of components over the wide data type, and a component
 * declared against a narrower one is not assignable to it.
