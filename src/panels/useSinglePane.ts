/**
 * One Terminal, streamed, outside the wall.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT `DashboardPage`'s CONNECTION. The Monitor's socket carries a whole wall: it
 * reconciles a subscription set against a filter, tracks per-tile health, modes, elision counts and
 * a live-attach budget, and its `sync()` is a function of page state. All of that is right for sixty
 * tiles and is the wrong shape for one — a page that embeds a single pane beside an editor would be
 * importing a wall's worth of bookkeeping to draw a rectangle.
 *
 * IT SENDS `focus` NOW, AND THAT REVERSES A DOCUMENTED DECISION — deliberately, and narrowly.
 *
 * This used to be snapshot-only on ADR 0020's cost model: a live attach is an sshd session, a PTY
 * and a per-viewer tmux session ON THE MACHINE, the wall is snapshots, and an embedded pane that
 * quietly went live would spend that budget without anyone choosing to. That reasoning is about a
 * FLEET Machine and it still holds there.
 *
 * It does not describe this pane. The pane beside an editor is the worker on THIS host — a local
 * tmux client, no sshd, no droplet — and it is the one pane an operator is deliberately looking at,
 * not one of sixty on a wall. The budget the rule protects is not being spent.
 *
 * WHAT THE RULE COST: a snapshot is `capture-pane`, a dump of the remote screen at THE REMOTE
 * SCREEN'S size, so it has no geometry of its own. MEASURED in the workbench — a tile that had
 * measured 135×34 painting a ~62-column screen, wrapping mid-word, because 62 was the width on the
 * other end. Resizing the pane could never rewrap a line, and no amount of fixing the layout would
 * have changed that.
 *
 * ONE SOCKET PER MOUNTED PANE. That is a real cost and a bounded one: this surface shows the pane of
 * the ONE workflow being edited, so the count is zero or one. The streamer already serves several
 * browsers.
