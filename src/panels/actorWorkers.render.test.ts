/**
 * The worker strip, DRAWN — what an operator reads before aiming a dispatch at this Actor.
 *
 * `renderToStaticMarkup` for the reason `HealthChips.test.ts` records: this suite runs in node with
 * no jsdom and no testing-library, and every assertion here is about text, `data-testid` and
 * `data-state`, all three of which are in the markup.
 *
 * THE ASSERTIONS THAT MATTER MOST ARE THE NEGATIVE ONES. A strip that draws nothing is the failure
 * this component exists to prevent — an empty rectangle where "nothing is polling this queue"
 * belongs reads as a widget that failed to load, or worse, as nothing worth worrying about. So
 * every state is asserted to SAY something, and the states that must not read as healthy are
 * asserted not to.
