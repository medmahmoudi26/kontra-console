/**
 * Who wrote this Dataset, and which of its rows a number is about — the panel on the inside of
 * the Datasets surface.
 *
 * IT ANSWERS THE QUESTION THE RUN STATUS CANNOT. A four-Machine `nscheck` run finished
 * `completed` and correct, and nothing in the console could say whether all four Machines had
 * produced a row. "Four were asked, three produced rows" is the sentence, and the half this
 * panel owns is the second: a Dataset knows who wrote it, never who was asked, so the Machines
 * that produced nothing are ABSENT here rather than drawn as zero.
 *
 * THREE STATES, TOLD APART ON SIGHT. A measured hostname, a gap where nothing was recorded, and
 * the legacy `w`/`0` placeholder — which is most of the data written before provenance travelled
 * with the Batch. They differ on four independent channels at once (border style, fill, text
 * colour, glyph) plus the label itself, so the distinction survives greyscale and a skimming
 * operator. The rules for which is which live in `datasets/provenance.ts`; this file only draws.
 *
 * AND EVERY COUNT ON IT SAYS WHAT IT COUNTED. A Dataset name spans **Runs** — `lame` holds 1,246
 * rows from two Runs of one workflow while the listing showed 623 for one of them — so the header
 * states its scope in words, and the Runs dimension lets an operator scope the whole console to
 * one of them and read "623 of 1,246 rows · this run". Both numbers in that sentence come out of
 * ONE statement, which is the only way it is honest: two counts issued seconds apart against a
 * Dataset a Run is still appending to are two moments, not a ratio (`datasets/scope.ts`).
 *
 * IT TAKES `provenance` AND RENDERS. The fetch is the console's, issued once when a Dataset is
 * opened — never on the listing poll, which already runs every 2 s against a catalog scan.
