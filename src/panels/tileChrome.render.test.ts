/**
 * WHERE THE CHROME SITS ON A TILE — asserted as an order, because that is the whole complaint.
 *
 * "And put the green banner on the bottom, like tmux." The status line was correct in every other
 * respect and in the one place tmux never draws it: row 2 of the tile header. Nothing about a
 * `data-tone`, a `data-feed` or a health signal could have failed for that, and the browser suite
 * does not select on the tile's internal order either. So this file renders the whole tile and reads
 * its chrome top to bottom.
 *
 * IT ALSO GUARDS THE HEIGHT BUDGET, which is the reason the bar could not simply be ADDED at the
 * bottom. `grid/wall.ts`'s `WALL_ROW_PX` is measured against the chrome a tile carries — a third row
 * costs every tile on the wall a line of a Worker's output — so the header had to give its second
 * row back in the same change. "One status line, and it is at the bottom" is therefore two
 * assertions, not one, and the second is the one a careless future edit will break.
 *
 * `renderToStaticMarkup`, not a DOM: this package's vitest runs `environment: 'node'`. Effects do not
 * run, so xterm never mounts — which is fine, because everything asserted here is chrome the tile
 * renders on the first pass. The screen itself is proven in a browser by the Playwright suite.
