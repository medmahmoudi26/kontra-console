/**
 * The nav rail, drawn in both of its widths and with each of the five surfaces marked.
 *
 * `renderToStaticMarkup`, still, and now by choice rather than by necessity. Every assertion here
 * is about text and attributes, both of which are in the markup, and a static render of a props-in
 * component is the cheapest way to draw one rail per state — thirty-odd of them in this file.
 *
 * IT DRAWS `NavRail`, NOT `SideNav`, AND THAT IS STILL THE RIGHT SPLIT, though the reason changed.
 * It used to be forced: zustand hands `renderToStaticMarkup` the SERVER snapshot
 * (`getInitialState()`), so a `setState` in a test moved nothing the container read — an earlier
 * version of this file seeded `view` and asserted the active item, which only appeared to pass
 * because `workflows` is also the initial value. With a DOM that is no longer true and the
 * container's own wiring is reachable; what keeps the split is that props-in / markup-out is how
 * every state gets drawn cheaply, including the ones the store cannot produce on demand.
 *
 * WHAT COLLAPSING IS ALLOWED TO COST. Width, the wordmark, the theme toggle and the throughput
 * spark — all of which are recoverable by one click or by visiting a surface. What it must NOT cost
 * is knowing where you are, being able to get anywhere, the one number that is about right now
 * (`live` counts Terminals holding a real PTY attach, and a leaking attach is exactly what you do
 * not find out by navigating), or the pulse — whether anything is happening at all, anywhere.
 *
 * THE PULSE'S FOUR READINGS ARE PINNED HERE AS MARKUP AND IN `chrome/pulse.test.ts` AS VALUES, and
 * both are wanted. That module decides which of idle, running, parked and not-known this is; this
 * file is about whether the rail actually draws it, at both widths, and whether an idle appliance
 * reads as idle rather than as an empty page.
