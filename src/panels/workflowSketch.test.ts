/**
 * What a workflow's sketch SAYS about itself: which pieces this installation has, which are yet to
 * be built, and which nobody has looked for.
 *
 * THE SPLIT IS THE FEATURE. A sketch is how somebody works out what to build, so drawing an Actor
 * that does not exist has to be an ordinary thing to do — and the surface has to be able to say
 * which half is which without refusing either. These tests pin exactly that, and the one thing that
 * would quietly hollow it out: `yet to be built` said about a catalog nobody has read.
 *
 * THE KEY IS PINNED HERE TOO. A sketch is attached to its workflow by its store id
 * (`workflowScratchId`), which is what makes it reload with the thing it is a sketch of — so the
 * derivation is a contract between the browser and `db/repo.ts`'s upsert, not an implementation
 * detail of either.
