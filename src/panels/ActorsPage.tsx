/** Actors: what is deployed and registered, as a grid of cards.
 *
 * WHAT ONE CARD SAYS is `ActorCard.tsx` — the Methods, their signatures and where an Actor's code
 * is. This file is the page around them: the two inventories, the join between them, and which one
 * the workbench is open over.
 *
 * THE ONE LIVE NUMBER ON THIS PAGE IS MACHINES, and that is not a compromise — it is the only live
 * number an Actor has. Nothing on either SDK's registration path carries a call rate, a p95 or an
 * in-flight count, so a card claiming one would be claiming it from nowhere. What IS real is the
 * Monitor's Terminal inventory: every Machine running this Actor has a pane, tagged with the
 * actor and version it is running, and its health probe says whether the worker is polling. That
 * answers the question this page is actually opened with — "is anything serving this queue" —
 * which is the difference between a dispatch that runs and one that waits forever.
 *
 * NO FOLDER, NO ACTOR. This page drew the CATALOG — every Actor any worker ever registered about
 * itself, on any machine — which after one real run was twenty-three cards, most of them saying
 * `source unknown` and `no registered folder`. Those are deployments the reader cannot open, edit,
 * serve, call or forget: a page of things you do not control, which is a page you stop opening. And
 * it fails the other way too — the catalog is a LIVE inventory that empties when the workers stop,
 * so the same page went blank on an installation with folders registered and nothing serving them.
 * A registered folder is a path somebody pointed at on THIS disk, and the four things this surface
 * can do all need one — so the folder is the unit, and a catalog row with no folder is not drawn.
 *
 * WHAT THE CATALOG STILL ADDS is everything a running worker said about that code: its Methods and
 * their signatures, the Machines serving it, the digest, and what the version broke. That is why
 * the join survives the inversion — `catalogForFolder` reads it from the folder's side, and takes
 * the version ON DISK when a directory has several deploys behind it, so four `cachebuster` rows
 * are one card rather than four.
 *
 * AND A FOLDER NOBODY HAS SERVED IS STILL A CARD, marked `unserved`, because register → edit →
 * serve starts there. It claims no deployment: its Methods are unknown rather than absent, and the
 * card says which.
 *
 * THE FILTER IS FOR WHAT IS LEFT. Even folders-only, an installation with several checkouts and
 * several versions is a grid to scan, so one row narrows it: a name menu that collapses the
 * versions, a box over every field including each Method's name and its author's sentence, and two
 * toggles for the states worth asking about. The count beside them is never conditional — a filter
 * that hides eight cards must not read as a page that lost eight.
 *
 * AND THE WORKBENCH SERVES IT — locally, on the machine the orchestrator is on, and nowhere else.
 * `kontra serve --actor` can also start managed containers or place a Worker on Machines that keep
 * billing after the tab is closed; neither is reachable from anywhere on this page, and that is a
 * decision (`backend/src/actorControl.ts`) rather than an unfinished dropdown. What the
 * workbench does have beside the editor is the worker's own tmux pane, because a worker that starts
 * and registers nothing is this system's hardest failure to see: the file saves, the serve returns,
 * the counts above stay exactly as they were, and the traceback is in a pane nobody thought to
 * attach to.
 *
 * AND CALLING A METHOD CALLS THE METHOD (ADR 0033). This page used to hand over code instead — a
 * caller workflow you saved into a folder, served and started — on the premise that the server
 * could not dispatch. What ADR 0023 §12 actually removed was a general INTERPRETER executing
 * user-composed topologies; the invariant that survived is narrower and still holds, which is that
 * the orchestrator starts workflows and does not execute Batches. So `call` on a Method row starts
 * one execution of a kontra-owned workflow that makes exactly ONE Method call over the Batch you
 * typed, through the same Nexus operation production uses, into an untagged Dataset.
 *
 * ONE ACTOR, ONE VERSION, ONE METHOD, ONE BATCH — and the count is the line. There is no control
 * here that names a second Method, because the request has no field for one. Two is a topology, and
 * the way to run one is the caller shown read-only beside the button: copy it, own the dispatch, and
 * compose inside your own workflow, which is where composition has always belonged.
 *
 * THE GRID STAYS THE LANDING VIEW. The Methods and their descriptions are what this page is opened
 * for; the workbench and the call panel are clicks through and take the whole surface when they are
 * open, because an editor in a card-sized box is neither.
