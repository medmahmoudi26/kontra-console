/**
 * The nav rail: five surfaces, what each holds, and what the fleet is doing right now.
 *
 * A RAIL RATHER THAN A TOP BAR, and it is a measurement decision. Most of these surfaces are
 * full-height columns of their own — the Workflows list, the run transcript, the Monitor's wall,
 * the Datasets schema — so a horizontal bar spent a whole row of a 900-pixel screen to say five
 * words, and every one of those pages then started 40 px lower. Vertically the same words cost
 * width nothing else wanted, and the counters at the bottom get a home that is not somebody's page.
 *
 * THE COUNT BESIDE EACH ITEM IS THE INVENTORY OF THAT SURFACE, so "how many workflows / actors /
 * panes / datasets" is answerable without visiting all four. They are the numbers a session starts
 * by wanting and then never asks again, which is exactly the shape a rail is for.
 *
 * THE PULSE IS THE DEBT THE RETIREMENT LEFT, AND IT IS PAID IN TWO PLACES.
 *
 * Retiring the global Runs view removed the one page that answered "is anything happening at all,
 * anywhere" — a question an operator asks from whichever surface they happen to be on, which is
 * precisely when the answer has to be in the chrome and not on a page. So:
 *
 *   THE DOTS ON THE WORKFLOWS ICON are the glanceable half. An inventory of RUNS, not of workflows,
 *     so they are marks beside the count rather than the count itself — `3` workflows of which some
 *     are running is two facts and must read as two. They survive collapsing, because a 48-pixel
 *     rail is exactly the state an operator is in when they ask.
 *   THE PULSE BLOCK IN THE FOOTER is the readable half: the word, the numbers, the sentence behind
 *     them, and the way in. It is a COUNT AND A WAY IN, never a table — restoring a global list of
 *     runs through the chrome would undo the decision the retirement was paid for. Clicking reaches
 *     a run the way every route to a run now does, through the Workflows surface.
 *
 * `idle` IS A WORD HERE, NOT A ZERO. The footer used to carry `in flight  0` beside `live panes  0`
 * beside `units/s  —`, and three zeroes in a column read as a page that failed to load rather than
 * as an appliance at rest. And a fourth reading — `not known` — exists at all because "we could not
 * ask" and "nothing is happening" must never render the same; see `chrome/pulse.ts`, which is where
 * all four are decided and where they can be tested.
 *
 * THE REST OF THE FOOTER IS THE OTHER THING STILL HAPPENING WHILE YOU LOOK ELSEWHERE. `units/s` and
 * its line are MEASURED — rows landing in the lake between two catalog samples, never an animation
 * (see `components/spark.ts`). `live` is how many Terminals hold a real PTY attach: an sshd session,
 * a PTY and a per-viewer tmux session on an `s-1vcpu-2gb` Machine each (ADR 0020), and it is the
 * number an operator most needs from a page that is NOT the Monitor, because that is exactly when
 * they have forgotten about it.
 *
 * SPLIT PROPS-IN / MARKUP-OUT. {@link NavRail} is drawn from its arguments and nothing else, so a
 * node test can render it with any surface marked, at either width, with counts taken and counts
 * not taken, idle, running, parked, mixed and unreachable. {@link SideNav} is the few lines that
 * read the store — zustand hands `renderToStaticMarkup` the SERVER snapshot, so a `setState` in a
 * test cannot move anything the container reads, and every state worth pinning would have been
 * unreachable through it.
