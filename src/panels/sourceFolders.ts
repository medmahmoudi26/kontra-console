 * is `/opt/kontra/actor/<name>` and matches nothing here. So the name is the fallback, with the

 * one run was twenty-three cards, most of them saying `source unknown` and `no registered
 * folder`: deployments the reader cannot open, edit, serve or forget. A page of things you do not
 * control is a page you stop reading, and a catalog is also LIVE — it empties when the workers stop,
 * taking the page with it. So a registered folder is an Actor, and a catalog row with no folder is
 * not drawn.
 *
 * SAME SCORING AS `folderForActor`, INVERTED, because two matchers for one relationship is how a
 * card ends up claiming a version the page does not think it has. The path is the strong match; the
 * name is the fallback, with an exact version preferred over a different one.
 *
 * ONE ENTRY, NOT ALL OF THEM. A folder holding `cachebuster` at 0.3.0 may have four versions in the
 * catalog from earlier deploys, and drawing four cards for one directory is the noise this change
 * removes. The version on disk wins; failing that, whatever the catalog offers for the name — and

 * opened, served, called or forgotten from this installation, offered as nodes to drag onto a
 * canvas. A sketch built from those is a drawing of a system the operator does not have, and the
 * generated workflow dispatches to queues nobody serves — which fails as a Run that waits forever
 * rather than as anything the canvas could have told them.

 * ONE ENTRY PER FOLDER, through `catalogForFolder`, so the version rule is the same one the Actors
 * grid uses: the version ON DISK wins when a directory has several deploys behind it. Two folders
 * that resolve to the same entry contribute it once — the palette lists Actors, not checkouts.
 *
 * A FOLDER NOTHING HAS SERVED CONTRIBUTES NOTHING HERE, and that is the difference from the Actors
 * grid. A card can say `unserved` and still be worth drawing, because its whole job is to be the
 * way into register → edit → serve. A palette node cannot: it would have no Methods, so no ports,

 * deliberate act (`register` is its own verb). Treating those as "not the current workspace" would

 * a way to lose your own registration. So the question asked here is narrower: does this path sit
 * under the workspaces PARENT, and if so, under which child. A path outside answers `undefined`,
 * and callers show it always.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS AT ALL. Registration is permanent and path-keyed; switching workspaces does not
 * unregister anything. Create a second workspace and both its Actor and the first one's stay
 * registered forever, so the grid drew two identical `hello@0.1.0` cards for a disk with one Actor
 * per workspace. That is not only clutter: both derive the SAME Temporal queue (name+version, not
 * path), so a worker serving one answers calls dispatched from the other — and the two tie in
 * `folderForActor`, which is how a call on one workspace's card read the other's schema.
