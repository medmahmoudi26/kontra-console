/**
 * A registered folder, opened: its files on the left, one of them in a READ-ONLY viewer on the
 * right — what is actually on this disk, at this digest (ADR 0030).
 *
 * THE SAME VIEWER THE WORKFLOWS PAGE HAS, and deliberately not a second one — CodeMirror, per-file
 * grammar from `workbenchEditor`, `editable={false}`. It used to write: CodeMirror with the
 * `PY_INDENT` unit, `indentWithTab` and Cmd/Ctrl-S. That was reversed because a dashboard that
 * writes to disk lets the file and the registered digest disagree, and the browser's job here is to
 * SHOW what is deployed, not to compete with the editor the operator already has. ADR 0020 made the
 * same call for Terminals. The grammar stays — highlighting, `.go` support, scrolling — because the
 * viewer is the point; the write is what goes.
 *
 * WHAT IS DIFFERENT IS THE FILE LIST, because an Actor is a FOLDER and a workflow file was a file.
 * `actor.py` is the code, `actor.json` is the manifest the SDKs read, and `description.md` is where
 * a Method's documentation comes from — all three matter, and a viewer that could open only the
 * marker (which is what `GET …/file` with no name does) would be a viewer for the least interesting
 * of them. `description.md` still renders its markdown preview beside itself when it is open; what
 * went with the write is the button that CREATED one, since creating a file is a write and the
 * operator makes it in their own editor now.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THAT EXECUTES IS SERVE, and it starts a worker HERE — on the machine the
 * orchestrator is on, in tmux, and nowhere else. `serveActor` records why that is a decision and
 * not a first step; what this file adds is the pane beside the viewer, because a worker that starts
 * and registers nothing is this system's hardest failure to see. Serve returns, the catalog says
 * what it always said, and the traceback is in a pane an operator had to know to go and attach to.

                    to the whole file, and this wrapper's `overflow-hidden` clipped it at the fold.
                    A definite height on the wrapper is not enough on its own; the chain from here
                    down to `.cm-scroller` has to be flex the whole way, or `height: 100%` resolves
                    against `auto` and means nothing. */}
