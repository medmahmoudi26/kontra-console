/**
 * Calling a Method: the half that talks to the server.
 *
 * TWO CALLS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM STARTS ANYTHING. `POST /api/sources/actor/:id/caller` returns
 * SOURCE — the caller shown read-only beside the button, regenerated as the form changes;
 * `POST /api/sources/actor/:id/probe` starts the one-shot workflow that makes the call (ADR 0033),
 * and `GET /api/probes/:runId` reads its answer back while it runs. What went with ADR 0033 §6 is
 * the third call this component used to make: the write into a folder.
 *
 * THE GENERATION IS AUTOMATIC NOW, and that is not a convenience. It used to be a button, because
 * a generated file that outlived its form was a file about a different Batch — the danger being
 * that you could then SAVE it. There is no save, so the only remaining risk of a stale block is
 * teaching the wrong thing, and the cheapest fix is for it never to be stale: the source is
 * regenerated whenever the Batch changes, debounced so typing a URL is not one request per
 * keystroke.
 *
 * IT NEVER SHOWS A CALLER FOR A BATCH IT DID NOT COME FROM. Every generation is stamped with the
 * draft it was made from, and a reply that arrives after the form moved on is discarded rather than
 * rendered — the same race a save button hid behind a click.
 *
 * THE MARKUP IS `MethodCallPanes.tsx`, for the reason the workbench split the same way: this file
 * holds state and fetches, that one is props in and markup out, and a node test with no jsdom can
 * draw every state of the second.
 *
 * THE FOLDER IS THE ACTOR'S. Both routes are keyed by the registered folder the Actor's code is in,
 * which is what pins the probe to one Actor and one version — so a card whose Actor was catalogued
 * by a worker on a droplet and never registered from disk has no call button, the same absence and
 * for the same reason as its missing edit button.
