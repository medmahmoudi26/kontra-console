/**
 * The open run's numbers, drawn — one line under the scope bar, on every tab.
 *
 * UNDER THE SCOPE BAR RATHER THAN INSIDE A TAB, for the reason `ScopeBar` gives for being one bar
 * and not five headings: the scope is a property of the page, not of whichever tab happens to be
 * open — and so is "is this run moving". An operator reading the Machines under a run is exactly
 * the operator who needs its rate, and a rate that lived on the Chat tab would be a reading you had
 * to leave the evidence to check.
 *
 * ONE LINE, BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS THERE. The retired Runs surface drew these as four 78-pixel cards
 * on a page that showed nothing else; this sits above five panels that each want the height, so the
 * numbers keep their size and their notes and give up the tiles. Nothing was dropped to fit.
 *
 * GROUPED BY AUTHORITY, WITH THE AUTHORITY NAMED IN THE SURFACE. `runStats.ts` owns why; what this
 * file does with it is refuse to let a group's numbers sit under anybody else's name — which is the
 * whole of "each keeps its own source" as a reader experiences it.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE ANIMATES AND NOTHING HERE IS SYNTHESISED. The spark draws the samples the app's one
 * catalog poll measured and draws NOTHING under two of them (`components/spark.ts`); the streak
 * draws runs that happened. Counts are `tabular-nums` so a digit changing does not re-flow the line
 * beside it.
 *
 * PURE, AND ASSERTED AS MARKUP. Every state — no run, running, finished, failed, produced nothing,
 * retrying, and the one-sample case that must draw no line — renders in node with no jsdom.
