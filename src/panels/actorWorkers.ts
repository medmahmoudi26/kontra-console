/**
 * WHO CAN ACTUALLY SERVE THIS ACTOR — registered, serving and stale as three different facts.
 *
 * THE THREE ARE NOT A SCALE, and collapsing any two of them is the bug this module exists for:
 *
 *   REGISTERED  the Actor exists. A folder on this disk, or a descriptor a worker pushed. It says
 *               nothing whatever about whether anything can run it — a registration outlives the
 *               process that made it, which is the whole trap `cli/workers.go` was written to
 *               surface: *registration says an actor exists; only a poller says it can run.*
 *   SERVING     a worker is polling the Actor's shared queue NOW. `DescribeTaskQueue` is the only
 *               thing that knows, and the freshness window below is what makes "now" mean now.
 *   STALE       Temporal still lists a poller that has stopped polling. NOT a smaller kind of
 *               serving: a dispatch aimed at it sits on a queue nobody drains and reports as slow,
 *               which is the failure this repo has documented as indistinguishable from the
 *               outside from a run that is merely taking its time.
 *
 * And UNKNOWN, which is mandatory rather than a fourth nicety: Temporal could not be asked, so
 * "nothing is serving" is not a finding — it is a missing answer, and a page that drew it as a
 * negative would report every Actor as un-served for as long as the cluster was unreachable.
 *
 * THE WINDOW IS MEASURED AND IT IS NOT THIS MODULE'S. `run/workflowState.ts:POLL_FRESH_MS` — two
 * minutes, one comfortable long poll of headroom — exists because Temporal keeps a poller listed for
 * about five minutes after it was last seen. Read raw, an identity reports a worker killed thirty
 * seconds ago as serving, for five minutes. Everything here goes through `pollIsFresh` so the
 * Workflows page and this one cannot disagree about whether a worker is alive.
 *
 * PER WORKER, NOT PER QUEUE, and that is the reason the route grew `workers`. The queue-level
 * `lastPoll` is the freshest poll across every identity: on a queue with one live worker and one
 * killed three minutes ago it is fresh, and a reader choosing a target from `identities` chooses the
 * dead one. Mixed is the normal state of a fleet losing a Machine, not an edge case.

 * failing signal; `null` NOBODY LOOKED — no Machine, or none whose axes were ever measured. The
 * whole reason this is not a boolean: `isHealthy` folds unknown into false, which is right for a
 * COUNT ("how many can I vouch for") and wrong for a LABEL, because "we never probed this" and "the
 * handler is down" send an operator to two different places.
 *
 * SEVERITY DECIDES, the chips' order: one `false` outranks every unknown, and an unknown outranks
 * the greens. So a fleet with one dead handler and two unprobed Machines reads `bad`, never
 * `unknown` — "we cannot see" must never swallow "it is broken".
 *
 * NO MACHINES IS `null`, NEVER `true`. An Actor whose Monitor inventory is empty has not been
 * found healthy; nothing has looked at it at all, and a green tick there is precisely the confident
 * lie this page keeps being fixed for.

 * from a host; a session is the process that host is running it in, and it is the thing an operator
 * attaches to. They fail independently: a session present with nothing polling is a worker that
 * booted and died in its import, and a poller with no session is a Machine the Monitor cannot see.
 *
 * GROUPED BY SESSION, NOT BY PANE, because a session can hold several windows (`cli/tmux.go` puts
 * the actor and its handler in one) and a card that listed four rows for one worker would be
 * counting windows while saying Machines. The mode and node come out of the Terminal id
 * (`chrome/tileRef` owns that parse — `Terminal.mode` is not on the wire), and the address is
 * `paneFilter.paneAddress`, so an empty `publicIp` reads as `local` here exactly as it does on the
