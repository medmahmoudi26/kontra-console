/**
 * Settings: what this appliance is configured with, and what it will hold once the store exists.
 *
 * THE SURFACE COMES BEFORE ITS CONTENTS, ON PURPOSE. Secrets have never had a home here at all —
 * they live in `.env` files and a provisioned `worker.env` — and the thing that makes that
 * discoverable is a page that exists and says so. What ships in this slice is the frame plus the
 * one section that is already real; the secret store, the slot bindings and the resolution audit
 * are their own work.
 *
 * A SECTION THAT IS NOT BUILT SAYS WHAT IS MISSING RATHER THAN BEING ABSENT, and that is the whole
 * of the design here. An empty page teaches an operator that this console has no opinion about
 * credentials; a page that names the contract — write-only values, actors declaring slots, the
 * operator binding them — teaches what to expect and where their credentials are until then. The
 * one thing it must never do is draw a form that silently keeps nothing.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A FIXTURE. There is no secret list to draw because there is no secret store, and
 * a plausible-looking one would be the worst possible thing to put on this page.
 *
 * PROPS IN, MARKUP OUT: {@link SettingsSurface} draws whatever sections it is handed, so every
 * state — none at all, one ready, one unbuilt — is a node test with no DOM.
