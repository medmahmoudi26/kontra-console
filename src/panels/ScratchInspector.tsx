/**
 * The sidecar down the left of the canvas: what the selected node IS.
 *
 * A BOX YOU DRAG CANNOT CARRY A PARAGRAPH. The node says `nscheck@0.1.0 .delegation()` and that is
 * the right thing for a node to say — but what `delegation` is FOR, and what it takes and emits, is
 * the reading that decides whether the edge being drawn makes sense, and it was reachable only by
 * leaving Scratch for the Actors page and coming back.
 *
 * AND THE METHOD IS PICKED HERE, which is the half the canvas had no answer for at all. The palette
 * lists one row per Method, so placing a node was the only moment the Method was ever chosen: place
 * the Actor before deciding, or grab the wrong row, and the node could only be deleted and drawn
 * again — taking its edges with it. `ScratchActorNode.method` was already allowed to be empty for
 * exactly that reason; nothing could write it back until this.
 *
 * WHAT A METHOD IS COMES FROM `MethodContract.tsx`, the same rows the Actors page draws. Two
 * renderings of "what this Method takes" would disagree eventually, and the one in Scratch is the
 * one nobody would notice going stale — nobody opens a sketch to audit a field table.
 *
 * THERE IS NO CLOSE BUTTON, and that is deliberate rather than missing. Which node is selected is
 * React Flow's own state (`onSelectionChange`), so a button here that only cleared the page's copy
 * would leave the node still selected on the canvas — and clicking it again would change nothing,
 * fire no selection event, and reopen nothing. Clicking the canvas closes this, which is the
 * gesture that actually deselects.
 *
 * SELECTION IS NOT IN THE DOCUMENT. A click must not dirty a drawing, and two people opening the
 * same Scratch do not share a cursor — so nothing this panel is handed is stored, and the only
 * thing it writes back is a Method the author picked.
