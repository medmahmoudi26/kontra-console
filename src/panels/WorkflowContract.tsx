/**
 * What a workflow TAKES, RETURNS and IS FOR — the three things the Workflows page could not say.
 *
 * The list beside this draws a file: a name, a size, an mtime, and a `description.md` if somebody
 * wrote one. None of that is the workflow's contract. The contract is in the source — the
 * `@workflow.run` annotations and the class docstring — and until the worker started pushing a
 * descriptor on serve (`internals/catalog.py:publish_workflow_catalog`) it never left the file.
 *
 * IT IS KEYED BY THE TYPE, NOT THE FILE, and the page passes the type it read out of the source it
 * is showing. A file can declare several `@workflow.defn` classes and each registers separately, so
 * a contract joined by filename would show one class's schemas under another's name.
 *
 * NOT REGISTERED IS ITS OWN STATE, and it is the common one: a workflow that has never been served
 * has told the catalog nothing, and saying "takes nothing" about it would be an invention. What is
 * drawn instead is the reason — nobody has served this type yet — because that is a thing the
 * operator can go and do with the button above.
 *
 * IT LIVES IN ITS OWN FILE so a test can draw it: `WorkflowsPage.tsx` imports CodeMirror at module
 * load, and the suite runs in node with no DOM. Same reason `ActorCard.tsx` is not in `ActorsPage`.
