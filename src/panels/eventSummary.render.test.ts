/**
 * The Summary on a row, and the sentence it carries — issue 30, drawn.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS AT ALL. Both halves of issue 30 shipped green: every suite passed while the
 * one pane that claims to show everything drew `TimerStarted timerId=1` for a sentence somebody
 * wrote, and drew a dispatch without the Method name that was put on its Summary precisely so no
 * payload would have to be opened for it. Nothing asserted either property, so nothing broke when
 * neither held. These are those assertions.
 *
 * NODE, NO JSDOM, NO TESTING-LIBRARY, like every render suite here: `renderToStaticMarkup` and
 * string assertions about the text an operator can read. What is asserted is never that a component
 * received a prop — it is that the words are on the page, and that the rows which have no Summary
 * still carry exactly the metadata they carried before.
