/**
 * What a card says about where an Actor's code is — the join between the two inventories on this
 * page, rendered.
 *
 * `renderToStaticMarkup` for the reason `HealthChips.test.ts` records: this suite runs in node with
 * no jsdom and no testing-library, and every assertion here is about text and `data-testid`, both of
 * which are in the markup.
 *
 * A CARD IS A REGISTERED FOLDER, so `folder` is required and there is no "no registered folder"
 * case left to test. The two states that remain are different sentences and collapsing them is the
 * bug: "not on disk" is fixable by putting the directory back, and it is not "here is an editor
 * over nothing".
