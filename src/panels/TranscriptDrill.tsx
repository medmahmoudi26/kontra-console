/**
 * The raw Temporal events behind one turn, and the child workflows they lead to.
 *
 * TEMPORAL IS ONE CLICK AWAY, WHICH IS WHAT THE VOCABULARY IS BOUGHT WITH. Every row in the
 * transcript is a rename of some events, and a rename nobody can check is a rename nobody should
 * trust. This is the check: the event ids the turn folded, their Temporal types verbatim, their
 * attempts, their one-line metadata, in the log's own order. An operator who disagrees with a name
 * can see exactly what it was read from and say so.
 *
 * IT IS A PANEL, NOT A PAGE, and it opens on the run already on screen. The retired Runs surface
 * made an event log a place you navigated TO, which meant leaving the account to check it — and
 * having left, the way back was another search. Here the transcript stays where it is and the raw
 * view opens beside it.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE FETCHES AT THE ROOT. The rows come from the reduced log the account was read from
 * (`RunTurnsRead.history`), so opening a turn is instant and costs nothing. A CHILD costs one read,
 * because a child is a different workflow with its own history — and that read is `useDrillLevel`'s,
 * one at a time, torn down when the level changes or the panel closes.
 *
 * NOTHING BLINKS. A live child's rows arrive in place on the same cadence the transcript uses; there
 * is no pulse on a new row and no spinner between polls. The only moving thing on screen is content.
