/**
 * Workflows: every caller workflow you have, what each one is DOING, and the pane its worker is in.
 *
 * THIS SURFACE CAME BACK, and the reason it was missing is worth keeping. It was folded into the
 * Catalog when Runs became addressable by id, on the reasoning that a definition and a run are
 * different things and only one of them needed a page. That was right about runs and wrong about
 * definitions: editing a workflow, serving it, and watching the worker you just started are one
 * activity, and they were spread across a page about files and a wall about Machines.
 *
 * THREE STATES, AND THE ANIMATION IS THE POINT. A workflow is `running`, `serving`, or `idle`, and
 * they come from two different authorities — Temporal's task queue for "is anyone polling", the run
 * list for "is anything open". Reading either alone gets it wrong, so `run/workflowState.ts` owns
 * the decision and this file only draws it. A fourth state, `unknown`, exists because a cluster
 * that cannot be asked must not render as "nothing is serving anything".
 *
 * THE DETAIL COLUMN IS A THREAD NOW — the open workflow's own runs beside five readings of the one
 * that is selected (`WorkflowThread.tsx`). What was here was a run table, a source pane, a worker
 * pane and a run log stacked down the page, each with a height the operator had dragged: four
 * things about one subject competing for the same 800 pixels, and no one selection governing any of
 * them. They are the same four things, under one. This file still owns the folder list, the header,
 * the serve/pause/run controls and the input form; it hands the viewer and the pane in as props
 * because neither can load under the test runner, which is what lets every state of the thread be
 * asserted in node.
 *
 * THE PANE IS STILL A TAB AWAY because the failure it catches is invisible anywhere else. A worker
 * that boots and dies — a TabError from a stray tab, a missing import, a queue nobody serves —
 * leaves a Run that simply waits, and no status on this page changes. The pane is where the
 * traceback is. It goes LIVE rather than staying a snapshot — see `useSinglePane`'s header for why
 * ADR 0020's cost model is about a fleet Machine and not about the worker on this host, and for
 * what the snapshot rule cost: a snapshot is a dump of the remote screen at THE REMOTE SCREEN'S
 * size, so resizing the pane could never rewrap a line.
 *
 * NO FOLDER, NO WORKFLOW — one row per registered folder, the same rule the Actors page follows.
 * The list used to draw two inventories: the files under `.kontra/workflows/` and the registrations
 * beneath them, which on an ordinary installation is the same two workflows twice, once by name
 * with a description and once by path with the name repeated. The FOLDER is the unit because it is
 * what this surface can act on — open it, serve it, start it, forget it — and a file row offers
 * none of those. A registration outside the default root is a workflow all the same, which is how
 * one comes to live in the checkout beside the actors it drives.
 *
 * THE FILE HALF IS STILL JOINED IN (`mergeWorkflowFolders`), because `description.md`'s first
 * paragraph is what a list of names cannot say. It contributes a sentence, never a row.
 *
 * A RUN'S OWN DETAIL IS HERE NOW, under `/workflows/<workflow>/<run>`, which is the address this
 * page already held. Its TRANSCRIPT — what it set out to do, what it called, what it wrote and how
 * it ended, in kontra's words rather than Temporal's — is the Transcript tab; what Temporal actually
 * recorded is the Event log beside it, which is where a drill from any turn lands. Its Datasets and
 * its sketch are tabs that are scoped and reachable and whose contents are their own slices.
 *
 * IT STILL MINTS NOTHING FROM A THREAD. A Run is one execution of a caller's workflow (ADR 0023
 * §12): the Run button here starts a REGISTERED folder by its declared type, with the queue derived
 * server-side, and the thread beside it only reads. There is no graph to interpret and no way to
 * launch an arbitrary one from a conversation.
