/**
 * The BROWSER ARM of `conformance/queues.json` §tmux_session.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE USED TO BE. A copy of `backend/src/actorControl.test.ts`'s cases, asserted
 * against `frontend/src/panels/actorSession.ts:actorSessionOf` — which was `actorControl.ts`'s
 * `actorSession` written out a second time, byte-identical including the `'' || '_' -> 'actor'`
 * fallback, one calling the shared sanitiser and the other re-inlining `.replace(/[.:]/g, '_')`.
 * Its own header called itself "a fifth independent derivation" and this one said "the cases here
 * are the same ones `actorControl.test.ts` holds — if one of these two files is edited alone, the
 * other is what says so."
 *
 * Two writers on the same side of a language boundary is not a contract with two writers, it is a
 * copy: the browser imports the server's function now, from the same `@kontra/core` package it
 * already uses for `@kontra/core/queues` and `@kontra/core/panels/ids`. So this file no longer
 * proves that two implementations agree — there is one — and what it proves instead is the two
 * things a collapse can still get wrong.
 *
 * ONE: THAT THE IMPORT RESOLVES FROM HERE. `@kontra/core/panels/tmux` is a path the browser bundle takes,
 * and a module that reached for `node:child_process` two hops down would break the app while
 * leaving every server test green (`.ds-entry.ts` records exactly that trap for
 * `@kontra/core/queues`). TWO: that the shared function still answers what every OTHER language
 * answers, which is what the corpus is.

 * THE CORPUS COMES OUT OF THE PACKAGE, not out of a sibling checkout.

 * while this directory was `frontend/` inside the kontra repository. ADR 0038 moved the console
 * out, so `@kontra/core` ships the corpora in `dist/conformance/` and this arm resolves them the
 * same way it resolves the function under test: through the dependency.
 *
 * Copying `queues.json` into this repository would have been the shorter fix and the wrong one —
