/**
 * What can be done to a registered folder, rendered.
 *
 * THIS FILE REPLACES `folderList.test.ts`, and the reason is the change it is testing. The folder
 * shelf is gone: it drew a row per registered folder above the Actors grid and below the Workflows
 * list, which on an ordinary installation is the folders those surfaces already name — the same
 * workflow twice on one screen, in two vocabularies. The path moved onto the row that names it, and
 * the affordances moved into one component.
 *
 * WHAT SURVIVES IS THE RULE THAT COSTS A 400. A discovered folder has no registration to remove
 * (`SourceStore.forget` refuses an `at:` id), so it must never be offered a forget button — and now
 * that two surfaces draw it, one component is what stops one of them forgetting.
 *
 * Rendered rather than asserted on helpers, because what is being pinned is a property of the
 * MARKUP. Static markup is enough: this holds no state, and its one handler is the server call the
 * API test covers.
