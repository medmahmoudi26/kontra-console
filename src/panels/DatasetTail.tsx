/**
 * The Data tab's row expander: ten rows of one Dataset, inline, without leaving the run.
 *
 * SPLIT ON PURPOSE, the same way `LiveRowTail.tsx` is. {@link TailBody} is a pure function of its
 * props, so every state — unopened, reading, a sealed tail, an open one following, fewer than ten
 * rows, no rows at all, a failed read — is asserted with `renderToStaticMarkup` in node, with no
 * fetch and no timer. {@link DatasetTail} is the thin wrapper that owns the request.
 *
 * THE STATE IS IN THE LEAF, AND THAT IS A REGRESSION GUARD RATHER THAN A STYLE — the same argument
 * `DatasetAccrual.tsx` writes down one surface over. Issue #14 fixed the results grid resetting on
 * every catalog poll by resting its identity on things a tick cannot change; a table of rows that
 * re-reads while a run is live is exactly the change that reintroduces that bug if its state is held
 * high. So `RunDataTab` holds NO tail state at all: each expander owns its own `open` flag and its
 * own rows, and React re-renders the component whose state changed and its children — so rows
 * landing here cannot reach the Dataset list above, let alone the console's grid.
 *
 * THE EXPANDER IS A `<details>`, so the browser owns the disclosure. Several Datasets expand
 * independently by construction (no `name` attribute, so they are not an accordion), the twisty
 * costs the list no re-render, and there is nothing for this file to remember when the operator
 * changes run.
 *
 * NOTHING IS READ UNTIL SOMETHING IS OPENED. A run that wrote nine Datasets issues nine requests for
 * five hundred rows each if the body is rendered eagerly — so the body is mounted only once `open`
 * is true, which is also what makes "an idle Dataset costs the server nothing" true here in the same
 * way `rowTail.ts` makes it true of its socket.
