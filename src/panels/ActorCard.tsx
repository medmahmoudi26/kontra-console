/**
 * One Actor's card: a registered folder on this disk, and what a running worker has said about it.
 *
 * THE FOLDER IS THE SUBJECT, NOT THE CATALOG ENTRY. `folder` is required, and the card no longer has
 * a branch for an Actor without one — that branch drew a row with no editor, no forget, no call and
 * no sentence the reader could act on, which is the noise the Actors page was inverted to remove.
 * What the catalog still supplies is everything a running worker knows and a directory cannot: the
 * Methods, their signatures, the Machines, the digest, and what the version broke.
 *
 * IT IS NOT IN `ActorsPage.tsx` FOR A MECHANICAL REASON, and the reason is worth stating so nobody
 * folds it back in: the page imports the workbench, the workbench imports the worker's pane, and
 * that imports xterm — which touches `self` at MODULE LOAD. `actorCard.test.ts` runs in node with
 * no jsdom, so importing this component from the page fails the whole file before a test runs,
 * with `ReferenceError: self is not defined`. What the card SAYS is the contract; it lives where a
 * test can draw it.
 *
 * THE METHOD IS THE UNIT, not the Actor. An Actor has many (ADR 0023 §9) and each self-registers
 * as its own operation with its own signature — `shout` taking a message says nothing about what
 * `title` takes — so a card that showed only `name@version` would leave a caller to guess the half
 * of the call that varies, and guessing wrong is a dispatch that fails at the actor rather than in
 * the editor. The methods are therefore always visible; only their FIELD tables fold away.
 *
 * SCHEMAS ARE RENDERED AS FIELDS, not as raw JSON Schema. The catalog derives them from the
 * author's own types (`takes=`/`emits=` in Python, `Takes()`/`Emits()` in Go), and a field table is
 * what a caller actually needs: the names and types to put in a Batch.
 *
 * AND AN UNDECLARED SCHEMA SAYS SO. Not every actor declares its types — `examples/go/dnsfacts`
 * and `examples/go/nscheck` do not — and an empty field table is indistinguishable from a Method
 * that takes nothing. That distinction is the whole reason the Actors page is worth opening, so the
 * absent case is drawn as absent, never as blank.
 *
 * AND A METHOD CAN BE CALLED FROM ITS ROW, which on this page now means it is CALLED (ADR 0033):
 * the row opens a panel that collects a Batch and starts one execution of a kontra-owned workflow
 * making exactly ONE Method call over it. One Actor, one version, one Method, one Batch — the row
 * offers no way to name a second, because the request has no field for one. It is drawn only when
 * the Actor's folder is registered and on disk, because both routes behind it are keyed by that
 * folder, and the folder is what pins the call to one Actor at one version.
 *
 * WHAT A METHOD IS, IS NOT DRAWN HERE ANY MORE. `MethodRow` and the field tables moved to
 * `MethodContract.tsx` the day a second surface needed them: Scratch's inspector lists an Actor's
 * Methods so an author can see which one a node uses and change it, and a second rendering of "what
 * this Method takes" would be the one that goes stale unnoticed. This page still decides WHICH rows
 * to draw and whether each one can be called; what a row says is one module's answer for both.
 *
 * AND A VERSION THAT BROKE A CALLER SAYS SO, ON THE VERSION THAT DID IT. The catalog compares a new
 * version's per-Method schemas against the one immediately before it (`@kontra/core/compat`, at
 * registration) and stores what it found; this is where that lands, because the version is what a
 * caller pins and the card is the only surface that shows one. Registration is NOT refused for it —
 * a breaking change in a new version is what versions are for — so if this strip is not drawn, the
 * break is invisible everywhere and the first thing to notice it is a run, in the shape of data
 * that does not fit.
 *
 * NO "COMPATIBLE" BADGE, EVER. The absence of this strip means nothing was reported, which covers a
 * first version, a Method that is new here and a schema that declares no fields — none of which were
 * compared. A green tick would be the one claim the check cannot support.
 *
 * DESCRIPTIONS TRAVEL NOW, and this comment used to say they could not. It said "a description is
 * not in the catalog — nothing on the registration path carries one", which was true until `209b0ad`
 * put a Method's own words on it: Python reads the docstring's first paragraph, Go types the same
 * sentence into `Does("…")`. So a Method with no description is an author who wrote none, and the
 * row says THAT — a fixable omission by the person reading it, not a field the system lacks.

                 (`…/probe`, ADR 0033). The folder is also what pins the probe to ONE Actor at ONE
                 version: the request cannot name either. So a Method offers `call` exactly when its

                 reason for both — a button drawn over a missing directory would 400 on a fact the
                 card is already telling the reader. */
