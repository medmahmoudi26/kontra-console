/**
 * Starting a run is a FORM, not a JSON blob — drawn.
 *
 * A workflow that declares its input gets a field per property, labelled and typed and marked where
 * it is required, the same way the Actors page collects a Batch. A workflow that declares nothing —
 * `ping`'s `dict`, or a run that takes no argument at all — keeps the raw JSON box, because a field
 * table with no columns is a form claiming the workflow takes nothing, which is the one reading the
 * contract beside it exists to prevent. The box SAYS which of those it is, since the operator can fix
 * one (write a type) and is meant to leave the other alone.
 *
 * IT LIVES IN ITS OWN FILE for the reason `WorkflowContract.tsx` does: `WorkflowsPage.tsx` imports
 * CodeMirror at module load and the suite runs in node with no DOM, so a form that page could only
 * draw would be a form no test could. Props in, markup out — native inputs, nothing that reaches
 * xterm — so `workflowInput.render.test.ts` draws every state of it.
 *
 * THE FIELDS COME FROM THE DRAFT, which `draftForInput` built from `readSchema` — the SAME reading
 * `WorkflowContract` draws its table from. So this form can never offer a field that card does not
 * show; they are one reading of the workflow's input, rendered at two depths: the card's table stops
 * at the top level, and the form goes all the way down through `FieldGroup`.
