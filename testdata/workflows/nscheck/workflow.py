"""nscheck — a whole run, infrastructure included, as one durable program.

THE QUESTION: for every domain in a list, which of its delegated nameservers fails to answer for
that domain? A nameserver in a zone's NS set that does not serve the zone is a lame delegation —
a resolution fault at best, and at worst a takeover, when the delegation points at a provider
where an unclaimed zone can simply be registered.

WHAT IS NEW HERE is the first four lines of the body. `examples/python/workflows/dnssweep.py`
shows the loop; this shows the loop WITH THE MACHINES IT RUNS ON inside the same scope:

    async with fleet.hold(tag="dns", machines=4) as f:  # capacity, and a Lease on it
        await f.place("nscheck", "0.1.0", sessions=8)   # what runs on it
        await f.ready()                                 # …and Workers actually POLLING, which is
        ...                                             #    not the same thing
    #  scope exit drops the Lease; the Machines go when the LAST one does

That is only trustworthy because this is a workflow. A script that provisions ten machines and
then dies leaves ten machines; this cannot, because the teardown is a replayable step in a program
Temporal finishes whether or not the process that started it still exists. Cloud machines that
outlive a run are a billing event and an OPSEC one.

ONE ACTOR, TWO METHODS, ONE FLEET. A stack carries a single actor — which is also what NAMES the
fleet, `<actor>-<version>` — so a run split across two Actors would need two scopes. Folding both
halves into one Actor (ADR 0023 §9) is what keeps this to a single `fleet.up`.

TWO WIDTHS, AS ALWAYS. `delegation` fans out — one domain with four nameservers emits four units —
so a 100-domain page comes back as ~400 and is re-paged before `ask` sees it. Skipping that step
puts 400 units through one activity on one worker, past the measured 200/1000 guard, with no
isolation boundary between them.

THE FINDINGS ARE THE OUTPUT, NOT THE ERRORS. `ask` emits a row for every (domain, nameserver)
pair including every failure — a refusing server, an unresolvable one, a domain that delegates
nowhere. Nothing here treats a broken nameserver as a dropped Unit, because a dropped Unit is
absent from `results`, and for this run that would mean silently discarding exactly what it went
looking for. `dropped` counts inputs that were malformed, which is a different claim; a Method
call hands it back beside `results` (ADR 0028 §4) so a run that dropped everything cannot read
like a run that found nothing.

TWO ACTS, ONE PROVENANCE. Production stages every verdict into a TEMPORARY Dataset; acceptance
promotes only the lame delegations (`where="NOT ok"`) into `lame`, after the fleet is destroyed.
The promotion is a provenance-preserving copy — every promoted row keeps the Machine, Actor
version and Run that produced it — so `lame` names all four Machines rather than collapsing to
one. That separation is the point: the raw verdicts and the curated record are two things with a
gap between them, and the gap is where a human would triage.

Run it:

    kontra build --actor examples/go/nscheck          # publish the Artifact ONCE
    kontra workflow serve examples/python/workflows/nscheck
    kontra workflow start examples/python/workflows/nscheck --wait \
        --input '{"dataset": "domains", "into": "lame", "machines": 4}'

    # `lame` fills only when the run PROMOTES, after the fleet is gone — it IS the lame delegations:
    kontra db query "SELECT verdict, count(*) FROM lame GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC"
    # every promoted row still names the Machine that produced it — four Machines, not one:
    kontra db query "SELECT node, count(*) FROM lame GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1"

    """The knobs this run reads out of its request — a DESCRIPTION of the body, not a new gate.

    Every one of these keys is already read below (`dataset`, `into`, and the three `_num` knobs);
    writing them down is what turns the registered descriptor from `dict`'s "any object" — which
    every surface correctly draws as *declares no fields* — into a shape the Workflows page can
    generate a form from. It changes what the catalog ADVERTISES, not what the workflow accepts.

    A `TypedDict`, deliberately, not a dataclass or a pydantic model:

      • It is a plain `dict` at runtime, so `req.get(...)` and `_num(req, ...)` below are untouched —
        in particular the falsy-zero handling `_num` exists for keeps working verbatim. A dataclass
        would force attribute access and a rewrite of exactly the code the type is meant to describe.
      • `total=False`: every knob has a default in the body, so none is required. The generated form
        offers them; it does not demand them.
      • Temporal's default converter decodes an unknown key straight through (its `value_to_type`
        keeps keys the TypedDict does not name), so a caller passing a plain dict — with extra keys
        or none of these — still works exactly as before.
