/**
 * What state a workflow is in — the three the Workflows page draws, and the one it must not fake.
 *
 * THE STATES ARE NOT A SCALE. They come from two different authorities answering two different
 * questions, and reading either one alone gets a workflow wrong:
 *
 *   SERVING   a worker is POLLING this workflow's queue. Temporal's `DescribeTaskQueue` is the only
 *             thing that knows. Registration says a workflow exists; a poller says it can run.
 *   RUNNING   a Run of it is open. The run list knows. A workflow can be running while NOTHING is
 *             serving it — that is a run whose worker died, and it is the most important state on
 *             the page, because it looks exactly like a slow run.
 *   IDLE      neither. Not an error: most workflows most of the time.
 *   UNKNOWN   Temporal could not be asked. Distinct from IDLE on purpose — a cluster that is
 *             unreachable would otherwise draw every workflow as un-served, which is a page-wide
 *             lie told confidently.
 *
 * A workflow that is BOTH serving and running is `running`: the run is the more specific fact and
 * the more urgent one.
