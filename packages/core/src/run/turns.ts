/**
 * One Run's account of itself, as the console reads it: the reduced log in, named turns out.
 *
 * THE REDUCTION HAPPENS HERE, IN THE BROWSER, AND THAT IS A DECISION RATHER THAN A CONVENIENCE.
 * `@kontra/core/transcript` and `@kontra/core/vocabulary` are pure — no DOM, no fetch, no clock they were not
 * handed, and between them exactly one import: `transcript.ts` takes `EventLink` and `RunEvent`
 * from `history.ts` as TYPES, and `history.ts` imports nothing at all. So the whole reader is a
 * pure function over bytes this package already holds, and `@core` is the alias the web app has
 * used to reach the orchestrator's pure core since `@kontra/core/scratch` and `@kontra/core/caller`.
 * `transcript.ts` says so itself, about the very type this module hands it: "STRUCTURAL, so both
 * spellings of the reduced log satisfy it … the reader is imported by both sides".
 *
 * WHICH IS WHY THERE IS NO `/api/runs/:id/turns`. A turns route would re-serialise a nine-arm
 * discriminated union over JSON to tell the browser something it can already compute from the
 * response it just received, and it would need its own cap, its own archive fallback and its own
 * `?exec=` — a second spelling of `/history` that could drift from the first. The claim-check
 * constraint (ADR 0007) is unaffected either way: `/history` is payload-free BY CONSTRUCTION, the
 * reducer never decodes and never fetches, so moving it across the wire moves no payload with it.
 *
 * THE ONE SEAM. Everything above the transcript asks this module for a run's turns and nothing
 * else; if the reduction ever does have to move to the server, this file changes and no renderer
 * does.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE THROWS. A run Temporal dropped for retention, a run whose first event has not landed
 * and a cluster that cannot be asked are three different sentences, and every one of them is
 * something the Transcript tab has to be able to print beside a run that is still in the list. They are
 * told apart on the way out ({@link RunTurnsRead}) rather than collapsed into a rejected promise.
