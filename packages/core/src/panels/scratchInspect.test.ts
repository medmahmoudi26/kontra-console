/**
 * What the inspector READS about a node, before anything is drawn.
 *
 * THREE PROPERTIES ARE WORTH TESTS HERE AND THE REST IS MARKUP (`scratchInspect.render.test.ts`).
 *
 * The first is that AN UNRESOLVED NODE SAYS WHAT THE AGENT WILL BE TOLD. `resolveScratch` on the
 * server decides what a sketch claims that the catalog does not have, and that sentence goes into
 * the spec; a second wording invented in the browser would give the author and the agent two
 * accounts of one drawing. So the sentences are asserted against the server's own function rather
 * than typed out here.
 *
 * The second is that NOT LOADED IS NEVER SAID AS NOT THERE. The lake listing polls and the workflow
 * listing is fetched once; before either answers the page holds an empty array, and reading that as
 * "no Dataset by that name exists" is a claim about the lake made without looking.
 *
 * The third is what a METHOD CHANGE does to the edges already drawn. It changes what the node takes
 * and emits — `fetch` takes a URL and emits a body while `title` takes a body — so an edge into it
 * was drawn against a signature that is no longer there. It is reported, and the document keeps
 * every edge the author drew.
