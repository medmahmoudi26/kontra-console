/**
 * The open run's own numbers — the fourth reading, which this page did not have.
 *
 * A RUN HAS FOUR READINGS AND NONE SUBSTITUTES FOR ANOTHER: the STATS (this), the per-Machine RAILS,
 * the DATASETS filling, and the EVENT LOG. The Workflow page carried three. The missing one answers
 * **"is this run moving, and at what rate"** — a run sitting in a retry backoff and a run doing
 * steady work both read `running`, and without a rate they read identically. That question is why
 * these numbers came back from the retired Runs surface rather than being re-invented smaller.
 *
 * FOUR AUTHORITIES, DRAWN AS FOUR GROUPS, NEVER BLENDED INTO ONE "PROGRESS" NUMBER. That grouping is
 * the distinction the retired Runs surface drew in prose, made structural — each number is printed
 * under the name of the thing that said it, so no reader has to hover to learn which question it
 * answers. `RunStats.tsx` is what draws these groups:
 *
 *   the LEDGER    what this run COMMITTED — the materialization records, run-scoped by
 *                 construction (ADR 0017). It says `unrecorded` rather than `0` when it holds
 *                 nothing, because those are different statements and only one is about the run.
 *   the LAKE      how fast rows are LANDING in the partitions this run owns, from the catalog
 *                 listing the whole app polls once (`App.tsx`). The only run-scoped RATE there is.
 *   TEMPORAL      activities scheduled and re-attempts made, from its own history.
 *   the RUN LIST  how the last twenty runs of this workflow ended.
 *
 * A ratio across two of them is refused for the same reason `datasets/scope.ts` refuses one: two
 * authorities on two polls are two moments, and a percentage over them looks measured and is not.
 *
 * THE RATE IS SAMPLED, NEVER SYNTHESISED. It reuses the store's existing series — `App.tsx`'s single
 * catalog poller pushes one rate sample per Dataset per tick (`components/spark.ts`), so two samples
 * of one clock already exist and nothing here re-derives one. `SPARK_MIN` then decides whether there
 * is a line: under two samples the spark draws NOTHING, because a flat line is a measured zero and
 * an empty slot is "nobody looked".
 *
 * ERRORS ARE A READING, NOT A COLOUR — see {@link Alarm}. The three that raise one are the three
 * nothing else on this page will tell you.
 *
 * PURE, AND FED ENTIRELY BY READINGS THE PAGE ALREADY HAS: the run list row, the followed run's
 * reduced history, the catalog listing and its rate series, and the run's own account. It costs no
 * request — which is also why every number here moves at the cadence of the poll that owns it
 * rather than at one this module invented.
