/**
 * The run's numbers, and the four authorities they must never be blended between.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED HERE IS THE PROVENANCE, NOT THE ARITHMETIC. Summing a series and counting an event
 * type are not what goes wrong; what goes wrong is a number appearing under the wrong authority's
 * name, or a silence being drawn as a zero. So every case below asserts which group a reading is
 * in, or which of the several kinds of nothing it says.
 *
 * THE THREE SILENCES ARE THREE ASSERTIONS, in both directions: a ledger nobody could read, a ledger
 * holding no record, and a record that committed zero rows are three different statements — and a
 * run that committed nothing must not be able to render as one that committed steadily, which is
 * the acceptance criterion this file exists to make mechanical.
