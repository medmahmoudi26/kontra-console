/**
 * What one node of a Scratch actually IS, read out of the same catalog the palette was built from.
 *
 * THE CANVAS CAN ONLY EVER SHOW A NAME AND A SHAPE. A description is a paragraph and a signature is
 * a schema, and neither fits on a box somebody is dragging around — so until this existed, an
 * author composing two Actors had to leave Scratch for the Actors page to find out what either one
 * does, which is the reading that decides whether the edge they are drawing makes sense.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE FETCHES. The catalog, the workflow listing, the lake listing and the column schema
 * are already in the page — the palette and the ports are drawn from them — so the inspector reads
 * the SAME arrays. A second fetch would be a second opinion about what this installation has,
 * arriving at a different moment.
 *
 * AND THE PORTS ON THE CANVAS ARE THESE READINGS. `scratchPorts.ts` turns what is resolved here into
 * the handles down each node's edges, rather than looking the node up again — two answers to "what
 * are this node's fields" is the failure that would let the panel say a Method takes `{url}` while
 * the box beside it draws a handle called something else.
 *
 * THE UNRESOLVED SENTENCE IS THE SERVER'S OWN. `resolveScratch` (`src/scratch.ts`) already decides
 * what a node claims that the catalog does not have, and that sentence goes to the agent in the
 * spec. Restating it here in different words would give the author and the agent two accounts of
 * the same sketch; one is what makes the difference actionable — the author reads exactly what the
 * agent will read, against the node itself rather than in a list at the bottom of the spec.
 *
 * AND "NOT LOADED" IS NEVER SAID AS "NOT THERE". The lake listing polls (`store.loadDatasets`) and
 * the workflow listing is fetched once on mount; before either answers, an empty array is what the
 * page holds — and reading that as "no Dataset by this name exists" is a claim about the lake made
 * without having looked. Both carry a way to say "nobody has asked yet".
