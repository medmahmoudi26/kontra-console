/**
 * Which Machines are THIS run's — the arithmetic behind the Monitor tab, kept out of the component.
 *
 * THE MONITOR USED TO BE A WALL OF EVERYTHING. Sixty tiles, every Terminal the streamer can see,
 * and an operator who had just started a run filtering it by hand to find the four Machines that
 * were theirs. That is the same shape of failure the global Runs surface had: the run and the thing
 * the run is doing were two different searches. So the tab is scoped to the open run, and this
 * module is what "scoped" means — a pure function from the run's OWN account plus the inventory to
 * the Terminals that account names, with the reason each one is in it.
 *
 * THREE WAYS A TERMINAL BELONGS TO A RUN, and they are three different facts rather than three
 * spellings of one:
 *
 *   workflow  it is the session the caller's own worker was served into. This is the pane that
 *             answers "my run is not moving" — a worker that boots and dies leaves the run simply
 *             waiting, with no status anywhere changing, and the traceback is only ever here.
 *   actor     the run DISPATCHED to that Actor at that version. Read off the run's own turns, so a
 *             Terminal is in scope because the log says the run called it, never because it happens
 *             to be running something with a similar name.
 *   fleet     the run brought the stack up itself. `FleetTurn.fleet` is `kontra-fleet/<stack>` and a
 *             Terminal's `fleet` field IS that stack (`<actor>-<version>`), so the join is the
 *             project prefix removed and nothing else.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE INFERS A MACHINE'S HEALTH FROM A RUN, and nothing infers a run from a Machine
 * (CONTEXT-MAP.md). A Terminal is in scope because the run's log named the thing it is serving; what
 * it is DOING is the streamer's to say, and the tile says it.
 *
 * "NOBODY LOOKED" IS NOT "NOTHING THERE", which is why {@link RunMachines} carries `read` beside the
 * list. A run whose account has not arrived has an unknown set of Actors — not an empty one — and a
 * panel that drew both as "no machines" would report a four-Machine sweep as machine-less for as
 * long as the transcript took to load. The caller's own worker is knowable without the account (its
 * session comes from the workflow's file name), so it is resolved either way.
 *
 * PURE, AND GENERIC OVER THE TERMINAL. It reads six fields, so it is testable with six-field
 * fixtures the way `topology.ts` is — and it hands the caller's OWN objects back, so the component
 * can put a real `panelsClient.Terminal` into a pane without a second lookup.
