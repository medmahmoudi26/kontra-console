/**
 * The address, read and written.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED HERE IS THE ROUND TRIP, in both directions and for every surface: an address a
 * colleague pasted has to become the store, and the store has to print back the address it came
 * from. Anything that only holds one way round is a link that opens the right page once and then
 * cannot be re-shared from it.
 *
 * AND ONE THING THAT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ROUND-TRIP: a retired address. `/runs/<id>` still names
 * a run, so it parses — into the address that run has NOW. It prints back as the new one, which is
 * exactly what makes the redirect a fact about the address space rather than a special case at the
 * browser boundary.
