/**
 * The URL, as a value: reading one, printing one, and the two translations between it and the store.
 *
 * THE URL NAMES WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT. Until this module the app had no router at all — `view`
 * was in-memory Zustand state and the bar said `/` forever, so every reload landed back on
 * Workflows, Back and Forward did nothing, and no surface could be handed to anybody. The three
 * things an operator most wants to paste to a colleague are a **Run**, a **Dataset** and the
 * workflow a run came from, so those are what carry an id.
 *
 * ADDRESS, NOT ROUTE. `route` is already taken in this codebase and it means an HTTP route on the
 * orchestrator (`run/api.ts`: "the history route", "the caller route"). `address` is the word this
 * repo already uses for the other idea — "a **Run** is addressed by its id and by nothing else",
 * "a Dataset is addressed by name + version + dt" — and an Address is exactly that written down
 * where a browser can hold it.
 *
 * THE STORE IS STILL THE API; THE ADDRESS IS A PROJECTION OF IT. `openRun`, `openWorkflow`,
 * `openDataset`, `watchTerminal` and `setView` keep their names and signatures and every caller
 * across `panels/` is untouched — they additionally write the bar. That is the layering and not an
 * accident: a surface asks the store to go somewhere, and where the store went is what the bar
 * reports. Nothing in `panels/` learns that a URL exists.
 *
 * A RUN IS NO LONGER A SURFACE, IT IS A SEGMENT UNDER ITS WORKFLOW. `/runs/<id>` became
 * `/workflows/<workflow>/<id>` when the global Runs view was retired, because a run is reached
 * through the workflow that produced it. The old address still parses and still means that run —
 * it redirects (see {@link parseAddress}) rather than 404ing, and the id survives the move. What it
 * cannot carry across is which workflow produced the run, which nothing in the browser knows: that
 * lands as `/workflows?run=<id>`, a run whose thread has not been resolved yet.
 *
 * NO ROUTER LIBRARY, and that is an argument rather than an omission. Five surfaces and three
 * entity ids is one `switch` in each direction; react-router would add a dependency, a provider and
 * a second vocabulary for `view` to a bundle already carrying 6.4 MB of JS. What it buys is nested
 * layouts, data loaders and route-level code splitting — this app has no nested layouts, loads
 * through the store, and already splits every surface with `React.lazy` in `App.tsx`. There is
 * nothing left for it to buy.
 *
 * A PATH, NOT A HASH. `backend/src/server.ts` already answers any non-`/api/` GET that is not
 * a real file with `index.html` (its `setNotFoundHandler`), so `/workflows/dnssweep/nscheck-123`
 * serves the SPA with no server change beyond the surface list it copies from `surfaces.ts`. A hash
 * could not 404 either, but `#/runs/x` is a worse thing to paste and it is never sent to the server
 * at all, which forecloses ever answering a **Run** address from the orchestrator.

   * a QUERY there rather than a segment because it is not addressing a position in the path — there
   * is no workflow above it to be under.

   * `pane` IS A FIFTH READING OF THE SAME PLACE, and it is a QUERY for a mechanical reason as well
