/**
 * When this Dataset's rows stop existing — the retention answer, on the Dataset's own page.
 *
 * WHY IT IS DRAWN AT ALL. A tag means KEEP (ADR 0029 §3) and the page has offered tagging for two
 * slices without ever saying what an UNTAGGED Dataset is heading for. "Untagged output expires after
 * the retention TTL" lived in a tooltip on a `+ tag` button, which is the one place an operator who
 * has not decided to tag will never read it.
 *
 * THE WORDS ARE THE CONTRACT with `backend/src/data/retention.ts`, which decides. Five of the
 * six dispositions here are ITS five, spelled the same, in ITS precedence: temporary first (a temp
 * is never swept on a clock — ADR 0028's ownership), then tagged, then open, then the age gate
 * against `TTL + GRACE` measured from the LAST WRITE. The sixth is what the sweep says by never
 * enumerating a Dataset at all — see {@link ExpiryDisposition}. Two implementations of one policy is a drift with no
 * loud failure mode, so the drift is made cheap to see: same words, same order, same constants, and
 * a comment on each side pointing at the other.
 *
 * "WOULD", NEVER "WILL", AND NEVER A DELETION TIME. Collection happens when a sweep runs, not on a
 * clock owned by this page: the sweep is a Temporal Schedule — armed at boot since issue 18, hourly,
 * and previewing rather than collecting until a deployment sets `KONTRA_RETENTION_COLLECT` — and a
 * Dataset past its cutoff sits there until the next firing. `would be collected` is true whether the
 * sweep runs hourly, daily, previews only, or is not armed at all, which is exactly why the word is
 * "would": this page states the POLICY's reading of a Dataset, and never a promise about a clock it
 * does not own. A line reading
 * "deleted at 14:07" would be a promise this seam cannot keep in either direction.
 *
 * THE CLOCK IS THIS DATASET'S OWN LAST WRITE; THE SWEEP'S IS THE RUN'S. `gatherCandidates` groups by
 * **Run** and takes the newest write across everything that Run wrote, so a Run still writing a
 * SECOND table keeps this one alive past what this line says. That direction is deliberate: this
 * reading can be EARLY, never late, so it never tells an operator something is safe that is not.
 */

/**
 * The untagged TTL and the grace behind it, from the contract both halves read.
 *
 * THEY USED TO BE A NAMED COPY, and the note here argued for it: they are compiled-in constants on
 * the server, and a round trip per listing row to learn a constant is a worse dependency than a
 * copy. The first half of that is still true and is why this is not fetched. The second half was
 * wrong in a way nothing could see — MEASURED 2026-08-27, changing the server's TTL and updating
 * the one test that pins its literal left this entire suite green with the two halves disagreeing,
 * and the Datasets page quietly telling operators the wrong expiry.
 *
 * `@contract` is types and constants with no imports of its own, which is what lets a browser
 * bundle read it. The server's `retention.ts` cannot be imported here — it pulls DuckDB and the
 * object store in behind it, and that is the fork's original excuse, now answered.
