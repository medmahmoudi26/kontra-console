/**
 * The live row tail on the client (live-datasets slice 05): watch a Run's rows land while its
 * Dataset is still `open`, read from the ONE durable path the server LISTs — `/api/datasets/rows/
 * stream`, its own SSE endpoint, not `/api/events`.
 *
 * GRANULARITY IS CHUNK, NOT ROW, AND THIS SAYS SO. The server reports `{rows, lastChunkAt}` per
 * poll of the durable path, so the readout is "1,203 rows · last chunk 4s ago" — a count and the age
 * of the newest blob, never an animated per-row trickle. Apify's storage is row-append; this one is
 * chunked blobs, and pretending otherwise is the same category of lie as a merged status field.
 *
 * A KILLED STREAM DEGRADES, IT DOES NOT FREEZE. `EventSource` fires `onerror` when the socket drops
 * (server gone, network blip); the phase goes `degraded` and the readout SAYS the stream was lost
 * while still showing the last count it knew — the operator must be able to tell "1,203 and still
 * live" from "1,203 and the pipe is dead", which a frozen number cannot.
