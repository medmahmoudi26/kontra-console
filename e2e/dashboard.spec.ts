/**
 * The Dashboard in a real browser — run TWICE, against two streamers (ADR 0020, CONTRACT.md 14).
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR. `pnpm typecheck` and both vitest suites pass on a view that throws on
 * mount, on a WebSocket that never connects, and on a terminal that mounts at 0×0 and paints nothing.
 * Every assertion below is a failure mode only a browser can see.
 *
 * Every spec here runs in both projects, because each answers a question the other cannot:
 *
 *   contract  the stub (`stubStreamer.mjs`) implements RFC 6455 and the tagged framing independently,
 *             so a pass means the BROWSER can read what the wire SPECIFIES — not what one author's
 *             encoder happens to emit.
 *   real      boots `PanelServer` with only the SSH/tmux seam faked, so a pass means slice 1's
 *             hand-rolled `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`, frame encoder, mask handling and close path survive
 *             the strictest client they will ever meet. Nothing in the stub executes that code.
 *
 * A DISAGREEMENT between the two projects is the most valuable result this file can produce: either
 * the stub has drifted from the contract, or the real streamer has a bug its own unit tests share an
 * author with. Neither should be smoothed over.
 *
 * WHAT NEITHER PROVES. No Machine in this environment can be SSHed to, so nothing here exercises
 * `ssh`, `tmux capture-pane`, the `ControlMaster`, or a live attach. The screens are synthetic.
 *
 * Selectors are `data-testid` / `data-*` only. A Tailwind class is a styling decision, and a spec
 * that selects on one turns a restyle into a broken stream.

 * How many times the stub screen's two SHORT lines are on the tile.
 *
 * NOT A LINE COUNT, AND THAT IS A CORRECTION. This used to count non-empty ROWS and compare against
 * `SCREEN_LINES`, which measures the tile's WIDTH as much as the repaint: an xterm wraps, so a tile
 * a few columns narrower turns four lines into six with one screen on it. It went to six the day
 * the nav rail grew from 196 px to 240 px — a change that has nothing to do with whether a snapshot
 * repaints, which is the only thing this test is about.
 *
 * TWO OF THE FOUR, and which two is the load-bearing part. `innerText` joins rows with newlines, so
 * a needle that straddles a wrap boundary is simply not in the string: the stub's two journal lines
 * are ~60 characters and wrap at any realistic tile width, which is exactly how the first attempt at
 * this fix still read `retrying once` as absent. The service line (~37 chars) and the marker line
 * (~36) fit on one row at any width a tile can have, so they are countable — and counting them is a
 * complete statement of the invariant anyway: an appended screen brings its own copy of both.
