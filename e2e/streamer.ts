/**
 * The real streamer, in the test process (ADR 0020).
 *
 * `PanelServer` is constructed here exactly as `backend/src/panels/server.test.ts` constructs
 * it — injected seams, injected `tokenVars` — and then a real Chromium talks to it over a real
 * socket. Nothing about the wire is re-implemented: `handshakeResponse`, `FrameDecoder`,
 * `encodeTagged`, `TicketBook`, `checkBearer` and the CORS/Origin checks are the shipping ones.
 *
 * It runs IN the Playwright worker rather than as a `webServer` child for one reason: the specs need
 * to reach in. "Two snapshots, different content, assert the second replaced the first" and "no token
 * configured ⇒ the UI shows the fail-closed 503" are both statements about the streamer's state
 * mid-test, and a child process would need a control channel — that is, a second wire to get wrong.
 * {@link serveFakeStreamer} is the same object with a `webServer`-shaped lifetime for a human.
