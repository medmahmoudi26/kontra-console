/**
 * The project's vite config with a PER-RUN dependency cache, plus the same-origin ticket mint the
 * page now needs (ADR 0020).
 *
 * Two vite dev servers in one project directory share `node_modules/.vite`, and when one re-optimises
 * while the other is serving, the loser hands the browser a broken module graph — measured as a
 * completely blank page. Dynamic ports fixed the listen collision between two concurrent runs; this
 * fixes the other shared mutable thing between them.
 *
 * The cache goes under the OS temp directory rather than the repo, because it is per-run: keeping it in
 * `node_modules/` would leave a directory behind for every run anyone ever does.
 *
 * THE PANEL PROXY EXISTS BECAUSE THE BROWSER NO LONGER HOLDS A TOKEN. The SPA used to read
 * `VITE_KONTRA_PANEL_TOKEN` and call the streamer cross-origin with a bearer; a token that Vite injects
 * is a token baked into the bundle, so that was removed. In production `orchestrator-api` mints the
 * ticket same-origin and adds the bearer server-side. Here vite plays that role: `/api/panels/*` is
 * proxied to the streamer with the header injected, so the page under test exercises the SAME
 * credential-free path it will in production, rather than a shape that only exists in tests.
 *
 * Declared BEFORE the project's own `/api` entry: vite matches proxy keys in insertion order, and
 * `/api` would otherwise swallow `/api/panels` and send it to the orchestrator API, which is not
 * running in a browser test.
 *
 * Everything else — the root, the Svelte plugin, the API proxy — is the project's own config,
 * imported rather than restated, so the page under test is built exactly the way `pnpm dev` builds
 * it.
 *
 * THE PROJECT CONFIG IS A FUNCTION AND HAS TO BE CALLED. `vite.config.ts` exports
 * `defineConfig(({command, mode}) => …)`, so spreading the import copies a FUNCTION's own
 * properties — which are none. This file did that, and what it produced was a config with no
 * plugins and no root: the React app survived it because vite transforms `.tsx` with esbuild by
 * default, so nothing looked wrong. Svelte has no such default, and `.svelte` files simply do not
 * load. Calling it is what makes "the same config `pnpm dev` uses" true rather than nearly true.
