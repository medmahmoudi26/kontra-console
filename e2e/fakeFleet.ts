/**
 * The SSH/tmux seam, faked — and nothing else is faked (ADR 0020, slice 1's `PanelDeps`).
 *
 * The browser suite boots the REAL `PanelServer`. What it cannot have is a fleet: no Machine in this
 * environment can be SSHed to, so `discover`, `probe`, `snapshot` and `converge` — the four injected
 * seams `PanelDeps` exists for — are answered from memory here. Everything downstream of them is the
 * shipping code: the hand-rolled RFC 6455 handshake, the masked-frame decoder, the `[idLen][id]`
 * tagging, the `\x1b[H\x1b[2J` snapshot prefix, the ticket book, the CORS and Origin checks and the
 * fail-closed 503.
 *
 * WHY THIS AND NOT ONLY THE STUB (CONTRACT.md 14). A real browser against the real streamer is the
 * strictest client slice 1's hand-rolled RFC 6455 will ever meet — Chromium masks every client frame,
 * verifies `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` itself, and closes with a real close frame — and none of that code
 * runs when the specs drive `stubStreamer.mjs`. The stub answers the other question (does the browser
 * read what the WIRE specifies, per an independent implementation), so both projects exist and the
 * specs are shared.
 *
 * Two Machines, on purpose: `kf-crawl-01` has its session, `kf-crawl-02` does not. That is the shape
 * that catches a wall which renders an absent session as a quiet tile.
